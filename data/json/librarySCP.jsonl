Woodson (1875-1950) | Dr. Carter G. Woodson pioneered the first Negro History Week. It was decided that it would be celebrated during the week that held the birthdays of both Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, two influential figures in the history of Black history. Prior celebrations have been documented as far back as the early 1900s and later was extended to a month-long acknowledgment of the historical contributions of Black people. | With the current social climate, celebrating and acknowledging these historical contributions is vital to preserving the true history of the Black culture. | “Black History Month shouldn’t be treated as though it was somehow separate from our collective American history or somehow just boiled down to a compilation of greatest hits from the March on Washington or from some of our sports heroes.” | – President Barack Obama's speech at the annual reception for Black History Month at the White House on February 18, 2016 | This year’s theme for Black History Month is African Americans and the Arts. “African American art is infused with African, Caribbean, and the Black American lived experiences. In the fields of visual and performing arts, literature, fashion, folklore, language, film, music, architecture, culinary and other forms of cultural expression, the African American influence has been paramount. African American artists have used art to preserve history and community memory as well as for empowerment.” ( | ASALH - Association for the Study of African American Life and History | ) | Learn more about how we’re celebrating Black History Month through the following events and exhibitions. | Events & Exhibits | An African American Book Festival: Celebrating Black Bay Area Authors | Hosted by SJSU King Library's AAACNA Studies Center | February 1 - March 16, 2024 | 5th Floor, AAACNA Studies Center | In celebration of Black History Month, a collection of Bay Area Black Authors’ books will be on display encompassing various genres, History, Biography/Memoir, Self-Help/Self-Awareness, Novels, Children's books, Christianity, Art, and Photo books.

Initiated by the CSU Chancellor’s Office, the Affordable Learning Solutions campaign was created to provide easy, direct access to inexpensive, accessible, and high-quality alternatives. | Affordable Learning Solutions Principles: | Choice | : Enables the discovery of course content, including commercial publisher content, library resources, and a wide array of open educational resources (OER). | Affordability | : Technology and partnerships that reduce the cost of learning for students and the CSU. | Accessibility | : Every student is entitled to a high quality education with access to all learning materials. | At SJSU, the Affordable Learning Solutions is coordinated by the University Library and provides information on how to lower the cost of classroom materials for students by offering faculty a variety of low-cost and no-cost educational resources known as Open Educational Resources (OER). Other resources include ebooks owned by the library, digital textbooks, open courseware, publishers’ repositories, the book rental program and textbooks on reserve in the library. | SJSU AL$ is made possible in collaboration with our campus partners: | Center for Faculty Development | Accessible Education Center | Provost’s Office | Spartan Bookstore"}

This exhibit is a continuation of the Black Spartans Project, representing ongoing research to surface documentation of Black experiences throughout SJSU history. | Black Spartans (1907-1948) | \"Black Spartans (1907-1948)\" represents ongoing research in San José State University Special Collections & Archives identifying documentation of Black experiences throughout SJSU history. | Much of the information we have comes from the Spartan Daily student newspaper and the La Torre yearbooks. With too few exceptions, Black Spartans’ stories are not told in their own words but from the perspectives of their majority white classmates. This is reflected in the language and focus of the articles. We invite you to read critically. | The | 19 | Black Spartans featured in this exhibit pursued their educational goals while contending with institutionalized racism and other major crises of the 20th century: two World Wars, the influenza pandemic of 1918, and polio. Locally, “the deed to virtually every home in San Jose” included restrictions against Black and Asian residents known as “restrictive covenants” (Spartan Daily, February 16, 1948, page 2). On campus, blackface and minstrel shows were a regular part of student events. | \"Black Spartans (1907-1948)\" is an invitation to the community to join us in surfacing these stories, ensuring these histories are preserved and presented in a way that honors these students’ lives.

Until recently, the significance of Black bodies in Bay Area history (as well as U.S. history) was overlooked. Unless it was associated with the struggles of civil rights leaders, athletes, or celebrity-personas, the story of a graduate from a state school wasn’t valued because we weren’t part of the mainstream culture. As a Black Spartan myself, I was deeply connected to these individuals that started out just like me. I saw a reflection of myself and my community throughout the process of making these 19 mixed media portraits and came to realize how important it is to know your history because it becomes a catalyst for knowing who you are. | My work explores the intricacy of identity and the role culture, tradition, and history play. These portraits are embodiments of our Black Spartans, they are visual representations of the colorful and captivating lives they led. Through this work, I hope to influence other artists and individuals to take part in researching and finding out the infinite layers of what it means to be Black. Our history is beyond our struggle.

Students who learned and worked with Kaya affectionately called her \"Ms. Kay.\" The studio closed in 1984 and Kaya began to volunteer her time with the Kimochi Japanese Senior Center and as a docent with the Asian Art Museum. In 2010, she received an honorary baccalaureate from San Francisco State University, years after her studies were interrupted by World War II. She also received a teaching degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Her passion for life-long learning and teaching continued throughout her life. In 2008, Kaya began working on a history project with Dr. Julia Curry Rodríguez at San José State University to build an archive that commemorates her parents and her life as a Nisei woman. She chose San José State University above other universities in the area because, as she described, San Jose is “manna from heaven” with its welcoming warmth. Housed in the AAACNA Studies Center at the King Library to expand the Asian-American Studies Center Collection and the Chicano Studies Center Collection in the areas of music and arts, the internment, oral history, and immigration studies, the endowment is a way of ensuring that her memory lives on and her love of knowledge continues. | See all items purchased with this fund | Give Now"}

This exhibit is a continuation of the Black Spartans Project, representing ongoing research to surface documentation of Black experiences throughout SJSU history. | Black Spartans (1907-1948) | \"Black Spartans (1907-1948)\" represents ongoing research in San José State University Special Collections & Archives identifying documentation of Black experiences throughout SJSU history. | Much of the information we have comes from the Spartan Daily student newspaper and the La Torre yearbooks. With too few exceptions, Black Spartans’ stories are not told in their own words but from the perspectives of their majority white classmates. This is reflected in the language and focus of the articles. We invite you to read critically. | The | 19 | Black Spartans featured in this exhibit pursued their educational goals while contending with institutionalized racism and other major crises of the 20th century: two World Wars, the influenza pandemic of 1918, and polio. Locally, “the deed to virtually every home in San Jose” included restrictions against Black and Asian residents known as “restrictive covenants” (Spartan Daily, February 16, 1948, page 2). On campus, blackface and minstrel shows were a regular part of student events. | \"Black Spartans (1907-1948)\" is an invitation to the community to join us in surfacing these stories, ensuring these histories are preserved and presented in a way that honors these students’ lives.

Until recently, the significance of Black bodies in Bay Area history (as well as U.S. history) was overlooked. Unless it was associated with the struggles of civil rights leaders, athletes, or celebrity-personas, the story of a graduate from a state school wasn’t valued because we weren’t part of the mainstream culture. As a Black Spartan myself, I was deeply connected to these individuals that started out just like me. I saw a reflection of myself and my community throughout the process of making these 19 mixed media portraits and came to realize how important it is to know your history because it becomes a catalyst for knowing who you are. | My work explores the intricacy of identity and the role culture, tradition, and history play. These portraits are embodiments of our Black Spartans, they are visual representations of the colorful and captivating lives they led. Through this work, I hope to influence other artists and individuals to take part in researching and finding out the infinite layers of what it means to be Black. Our history is beyond our struggle.

Whether created by government or by corporations, the production-incentive posters conveyed social, economic, and political ideas through imagery. Throughout the war, the imagery on such posters celebrated the middle-class home, the traditional nuclear family, consumerism, and free enterprise. Pictures of men and women conveyed assumptions about the roles of each in victory and offered a vision of life in an ideal postwar period. This exhibit presents selections from a collection of approximately 1447 World War I and II posters collected by professor Charles Burdick. The posters provide a graphic portrayal of propaganda used to educate the public and enlist support for the war. | 24 Inspiratonal Posters Bound to Boost Production | 4 Reasons for buying Victory Bonds | A Careless Word...

In attempts to adapt to the rapidly changing global climate, mass production of key messages and propaganda became a necessity which was met by the exponentially increased usage of posters on the home front. These posters were utilized to inform civilians of their wartime duties, such as production labor, women joining the workforce, buying bonds, and supporting the government. Government agencies and private organizations in countries around the world created and distributed propaganda posters. The rise in popularity of the poster medium is credited to their inexpensive manufacturing costs and accessibility, for they were posted in numerous locations, from the workroom floor to street corners and store windows. | La Sale Mouche (The Dirty Fly) | Remember Dec 7th | Save Freedom of Speech: Buy War Bonds | The more Women at work the sooner we Win"}

During the late 19th century participation in physical education and athletics was encouraged and expected. In the early years (1870-1920) Students played a variety of sports including basketball, tennis, volleyball, hockey, baseball, and naturally football. Male and female teams were formed in all areas, but during the formative years of the college, women clearly dominated the student body. By the 1920s, the gender ratio of the Normal School became more balanced, which gave rise to new academic programs, including a physical education program. | 1942 | Athletic Exhibit Promotion | San Jose State Men's 1948 Baseball Team | San Jose State Men's 1950 Swim Team | San Jose State Normal School Women's  Basketball Team | San Jose State Women's 1939 Basketball Team | Spartan Marching Band | Spartan Shield"}

While for the most part they were legally defined as white citizens, they were commonly viewed as interloping, non-white immigrants and became objects of discrimination, segregation, and violence, targeted by such groups as the Ku Klux Klan. In Santa Clara County, Mexican agricultural and cannery workers addressed the problems by generating a cultural identity that allowed it to become one of the most important, vibrant Mexican cultural communities in the Southwest during the 1940s and 1950s. | These settled Mexicans and Mexican Americans sought to rectify the social injustices they faced by forming early labor and political organizations, particularly after WWII. Mexicans in Santa Clara County contributed significantly to the growth of the Mexican American civil rights movement, including the rise of Mexican American social justice organizations such as the GI Forum and The Community Service Organization.  Two of the most celebrated Mexican civil rights leaders, Ernesto Galarza and Cesar Chavez, began their careers in Santa Clara County in the 1940s and 1950s. | By the 1970s, Silicon Valley industries were bulldozing fruit farms and replacing them with tech factories, and long-time Mexican residents moved into the margins of urban work and community awareness of their important contributions to the Santa Clara County. Now forgotten, the history of Mexicans in Santa Clara County’s agricultural and cannery history is an important chapter in the story of California’s and America’s civil rights history-its labor struggles, ethnic resilience, and creative adaptation and cultural production as components in the fight for equality. | One of the unique aspects of this project has been the principal use of an extensive collection of oral history interviews with and personal photos of Mexican and Mexican American workers, artists, musicians, and community leaders. Interview clips have been incorporated into the mini-documentaries, and quotes from interviews are used in the Online Exhibit.  The interviews were collected over a 50-year period. During the 1970s, Margo McBane collected the earliest interviews with agricultural worker Pearl Rios, 1930s CAWIU cannery organizers Dorothy Ray Healey and Elizabeth Nicholas, and CSO organizer Fred Ross Sr.  We have also included information from a 1970s Mexican/Japanese/Spanish oral history project conducted by two Stanford University students, which now reside at Mountain View Public Library through the Mountain View Historical Association.  Especially in dealing with previously undocumented  history, community-based oral history techniques breathe new life into the writing of history.  Mexican workers become active participants in the writing of their own story by sharing their lives, their photos and their network of community contacts.  Through oral history and by establishing a basis of trust, historians can delve deeply into community memory. | We would like to thank our funders including Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, San José State University, NEH, Farrington Family Foundation, Silicon Valley Community Foundation, California Humanities, the City of San José’s Abierto Fund, and individual donors. | Public Programs | The Before Silicon Valley Project: | \" | A Women Public Historians’ Website Project on Mexican American Agricultural and Cannery Workers | \". at the American Historical Association affiliated society The Coordinating Council for Women in History Session 1, | 1:30-3 pm Rooms 5 & 6, Hilton Hotel 4th Floor on Jan. 4, 2024. | To attend register at AHA 2024 Conference Website: | AHA 2024 Conference Registration | Exhibit | Media | (Under Construction) | Collections | (Under Construction) | For Educators | (Under Construction) | About | (Under Construction)"}

After he graduated he joined the Missouri Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and in 1936 with his camp he was relocated to California. The camp settled in the New Almaden Quicksilver County Park. As the resident artist of the camp he was hired to document life in the CCC. His forte was linoleum cuts, but he also worked with oil and acrylic, as well as having talent in wood art and mosaics. | In 1938 Kessler took a bicycle trip visiting every California Mission in the state, which he sketched and photographed and later produced beautiful linoleum cuts of each mission. The resulting prints were exhibited around California and at the World’s Fair in Treasure Island and the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. Kessler reproduced these images into greeting cards and the book on display and surrogate digital images illustrate his talent in linoleum cut printmaking."}

The City of San José had not previously developed a historic context for Mexican Americans in the 20 | th | Century. This left the question of the level of significance to be determined.   Documentation of historical resources, buildings, structures, objects, sites, and cultural landscapes typically include archival and oral history research.  Oral history projects are framed within an historic context based on archival research, which considers events, places and people. | A thorough search of regional archives revealed the lack of documentation on | the local Mexican American community available in any regional archive or published history. | Though the histories of many agricultural industries have been written, agricultural and cannery worker communities have not been as well documented.  In order to address the lack of documentation on worker communities, our contracts, pursued by Guerra & McBane LLC, now specified that oral history interviews were always accompanied by the digital retrieval of personal archives and that a copy of the final studies and reports would be donated to a publicly accessible repository. | Based on our initial research from 2003-2005 we framed a project concept that we called | Cherries to Chips: A Regional History of Santa Clara Valley Communities. | We envisioned | a comprehensive history of agricultural worker communities of the Santa Clara Valley and its transformation from one of California’s major agricultural landscapes into the internationally recognized technological incubator known as the “Silicon Valley”.  In 2004-2006, The Sourisseau Academy for State and Local History of the SJSU History Department gave our project $3,000 to conduct oral history interviews with Mexican cannery workers in Santa Clara County. | From 2006-2007, we received a $25,000 contract from the local museum History San José, to conduct research for their new online exhibit entitled | Cannery Life, | documenting the soon to be demolished Del Monte Cannery No. 3.  What we learned on this project would eventually cause us to refocus our efforts on the Mexican agricultural and cannery population during the period from 1920 to 1960, a time when labor and social organizing was at its peak, agricultural industries were dominant, and migration and immigration were influenced by world events such as the Great Depression, the Mexican Revolution and two World Wars. | At that time, | History San José had no contacts in the Latino community and no one spoke Spanish, so we were able to retain more control over the structure of the project as long as we met their timeline. We implemented some new strategies in our research. Utilizing a number of trained Spanish speaking SJSU students from Margo McBane’s California and Local History classes at San José State University, we were able to form a bilingual research team and tap into their social networks to identify fifteen cannery employees.  Video interviews were conducted in Spanish and in English, with Spanish transcripts translated into English. Many of the workers had retained personal artifacts, along with photos of the workplace, which they shared with us, and we facilitated their donation to History San José.  Over the years, many of these same students that worked this project became the corps of researchers for our later efforts, continuing to work after graduation. | The insights gained from our research encouraged us to revise our project concept, and in 2007 it became the | Before Silicon Valley Project: Mexican Agricultural and Cannery Workers in Santa Clara County, 1920-1960, | envisioned as a national traveling exhibit with website and online exhibit | . | We also began to identify several overall themes and an approach that framed the 20 | th | century Mexican American history we were retrieving within recent research in Labor, Women’s, American History, Ethnic Studies and the Long Civil Rights Movement. In 2007, we received $7,500 from the Farrington Historical Foundation to continue collecting and processing Mexican cannery worker interviews.  In 2010, we received a $29,000 Global Institute SJSU Grant that enabled us to further develop the exhibit concept. | In 2011, sponsored by San José State University, and co-directed by Dr. Ann Fountain, professor of World Languages and Literature and Dr. Margo McBane, History lecturer at SJSU, we applied for an $80,000 NEH Planning Grant but received only a $40,000 Grant to design and plan a traveling and online exhibit. This was the first grant from NEH ever received by SJSU0. We then pursued local grants and contracts to make up for the shortfall in the NEH Grant that would  enable us to conduct and process 25 additional oral history interviews based on the new exhibit themes.  During 2011-2012, we received a  $12,000 Castellano Family Foundation grant to continue collecting and processing Mexican agricultural workers oral history interviews. | That same year, The County of Santa Clara contracted Guerra & McBane, LLC to conduct | Oral Histories in Support of Cultural Resources Study of Sites Associated with Cesar Chavez National Heritage Trail. | We interviewed family and associates of César Chávez in Spanish and in English, and documented the role of Guadalupe Church with Fr. McDonnell Hall as a center for community organizing and training. This research contributed to a proposed National Historic Landmark nomination on César Chávez and agricultural labor rights. | Ten years after Suzanne conducted the first study of the Palomar, in 2012, The City of San José contracted Guerra & McBane LLC to research, plan and create an interpretive exhibit to mitigate the demolition of the Palomar Ballroom, listed on the National Register.  Oral history interviews would form the core of our research this time.  Reaching out again to community contacts, we conducted interviews with musicians, singers, band managers, venue managers, entertainment writers and former patrons.  These interviews enabled us to profile the history of the Ballroom as a regional center for social, cultural and political activity, and San José as a regional hub for the Mexican American community in Northern California. | In 2016, local interest in our cannery worker research was growing.  We were asked for 2016 Hispanic Heritage Month to give a talk on San José Mexican Cannery Women at the Eastside Branch of San Jose Public Library.  Over 150 people attended, with one of the attendees asking us to present the same talk for Women’s History Month at the San José Women’s Club Annual Meeting. In 2017 we continued our research and representation back to the community with a California Humanities funded Quick Grant Project | Cannery Workers, Cannery Lives Community Conversation | for Hispanic Heritage Month | . | We had an Oral History/Photo Scan Day in SJSU Special Collections in late September. In early October | we represented the oral history information back to the community through Community Conversations held at two branch libraries of San José Public Library.  These Public Programs included a cannery worker panel, a scholar talk and mini-documentary program. Programs were very well attended, with friends and family of interviewees and the general public, and expanded on our network of community contacts. | After reviewing the original NEH proposal with our advisors in 2014-2016, we did additional research and completely revised our proposal in preparation for applying for an NEH Implementation Grant to create the traveling and online exhibit. After several unsuccessful applications to the NEH Implementation Grant for Museums and Historical organizations, with the offer of Kathryn Blackmer Reyes to host the Website on the AAACNA (Africana, Asian American Chicano, and Native American) Cultural Center web page,  we decided just to pursue an Online Exhibit. In 2019, through the San José Parks Foundation, we then applied for and received a $202,000 Santa Clara County Heritage Fund Grant for the bilingual BEFORE SILICON VALLEY PROJECT Website hosted by the SJSU Library.  Further funding from The Silicon Valley Community Foundation and individual donors allowed us to complete the mini-documentaries for the online exhibit. | From the beginning of this Project it has been important to us to bring all the information shared with us back to the communities from which it came. Funded by the The San José City Abierto Grant and California Humanities “Humanities for All” Grant,  starting in 2023 we held 6 public programs. To commemorate César Chávez Day, in April through May 2023, with over 300 people attending, we helped to organize a Cannery Worker Commemoration at The Gardner Community Center, in the heart of the Mexican cannery worker neighborhood.   After this success, we held five more Public Programs, attracting over 300 people in total, featuring a similar format:  a Scholar Speaker, a featured Mini-Documentary, and an introduction to the Website.  These public programs covered the topics of “Mexican Civil Rights in the 1950s”, “Mexican Women Cannery Workers”, “Mexican Orchard and Field Workers” and “Mexican Bands and Music, 1920-1960”.  They were held at Mt View Historical Association in collaboration with Los Altos History Museum, The History Center at De Anza College, Gavilan College, and The Fire Hose at History San José sponsored by The La Raza Historical Society. | For Hispanic Heritage Month 2023, attracting over 200 attendees, we held in one day a 10 mile Bicycle History Tour of Mexican Sites in San José as well as a Mexican Tardeada/Family Dance featuring a taco truck and a 15 piece orchestra (with players from the descendants of the original Bernie Fuentes Band). | Directors | Margo McBane, Ph.D. (2007-2024) Project Lead Director | : Oral History Supervisor, Mini-Docs Supervisor, Website Supervisor, Online Exhibit Supervisor, Grant Writing Supervisor,

In the 1960s and 1970s, large sections of the old Mexican | colonias | in Mountain View and downtown San José would be demolished through urban renewal, street development, and freeway construction, displacing families and businesses. At the same time the Spanish-surnamed population in Santa Clara County rose from 14 to 21 percent, the largest number of ethnic Mexicans in Santa Clara County living in the Eastside San José | colonia | with its poor quality housing and inadequate services.  Compounding these issues was the replacement of the agricultural economy with an urban, manufacturing/technology driven economy. As canneries closed, cannery workers found themselves losing middle-class incomes and benefits gained through union contracts that had provided them with a level of economic security. | As the economy of Santa Clara County transformed from agriculture to high tech, social changes within the nation during the 1960s and 1970s impacted the County as well. The social justice movements of that period included organizations seeking broad societal change. The Environmental Movement began to link social justice to environmental justice. The Women’s Movement fought for equal rights and equal pay, and the Anti-War Movement questioned the Vietnam War.  African Americans, Native Americans and Asian Americans continued the fight against racial disparity through a new Civil Rights Movement, and a new generation of Latinos/Mexican Americans formed the Chicano Movement. | During the 1960s and 1970s, social justice movements were sometimes confrontational, using protests, sit-ins, walkouts, and strikes. New strategies and legal challenges extended the right to vote to 18-year-olds.  Policies were adopted by state and local governments that attempted to address the disparities of race, class, gender segregation, housing discrimination, and access to education. | During this time, the Chicano Movement embraced cultural work and practiced political tactics that differed from their civil rights predecessors in the 1920s – 1960s. Two of the leading groups that organized the Mexican American and Latino people were the League of United Latin American citizens (LULAC) and the Community Service Organization (CSO). The CSO focused on integrating them into American society through political reform and legal challenges. In contrast, the new generation of community activists of the 1960s and 1970s embraced a more adversarial approach, promoting cultural nationalism or | Chicanismo | .  This was a generational shift. The new group of leaders chose to affirm their ethnic identity and Mexican cultural heritage rather than pursue a claim of legal equality with the dominant White/Anglo American society.  The early ethnic Mexican labor and civil rights struggles in Santa Clara County between 1920 to 1960 established the foundation upon which  the Chicano Movement was built. | Note: The term “ | Chicano | ” had been used as a slur during the 1930s and 1940s when it was | applied to | lower class Mexicans | . It was reclaimed in the 1940s by young people who identified with the Pachuco/a subculture, and reflected an American identity with roots in Mexican culture.  I | n the 1960s, it was adopted by the Chicano Movement, which sought political empowerment by promoting ethnic solidarity and pride in their southwest indigenous heritage | EXHIBIT | Jesús Manuel Mena Garza, Education Marchers, Garza Personal Collection, From 1970-1975 Series.

When the Estradas died in 1845 they left their land to Inez’s father, Mariano Castro. Castro sold the eastern half of the rancho, what is now Sunnyvale, to Irishman Martin Murphy, Jr.  Murphy had arrived in 1844 and  planted Santa Clara County’s first orchard on his newly acquired land. Castro died in 1856, leaving the Mountain View portion to his son, Crisanto Castro. Like other Mexican | Californios | , the Castros fought in the American courts from 1852 to 1871 to validate their land grants but lost most of it to squatters and lawyers fees. The Castro family remained in Mountain View until 1958, when they sold their remaining 23.5 acres to the City of Mountain View. | In the early 1900s Spanish immigrants arrived in Santa Clara County. Many who had worked in the orchards and canneries in the 1920s and 1930s moved to Mountain View, California, settling in the northern section of the city above the canneries, packinghouses and  railroads. These included the Mountain View Fruit Packing Company, Clark Canning, and San José Fruit Preserving Company.  Around 1920, the P.L. Sanguinetti Cannery in Mountain View was acquired by the Richmond-Chase Cannery, one of the largest in California. | Sharing a common language, the Spanish community welcomed Mexican immigrants who arrived in Mountain View during and after WWII. This would eventually transform the Spanish neighborhood into the Mountain View Mexican | Colonia | .  In such a small town, Mexicans did | not form a separate commercial district but melded cultural traditions and a shared language.   St. Joseph Catholic Church became the heart of the | C | olonia | , and during the late 1940s to 1950 Father Donald McDonnell encouraged the Mexican community to address their financial, economic, and social needs by creating Club Estrella as well as a community credit union. Club Estrella hosted annual church and community events for the entire Spanish speaking community.  Increasing urbanization and highway expansion during the 1950s and 1960s brought major thoroughfares through the heart of the district and decimated the established Mountain View | C | olonia | .  Father McDonnell was assigned to the Mexican mission in Eastside San José in 1951, and helped establish the San José de Guadalupe Church and became a mentor to César Chávez. | 1  of | 17 | Title/Caption:  Father Donald McDonnell, Parish Priest in Mountain View 1947 | Date: 1947 | Collection: Nick Perry Family Collection | Owning Institution: Mountain View Historical Association | Source: Mountain View Public Library | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | Castro Family Timeline | The Birth and Breaking of a Forgotten Community | Bittersweet: Memories of Old Mountain View | Mountain View Photographs & Oral Histories (Includes Mexican Worker Interview) | Mountain View Public Library History Page | The Gilroy Colonia, WWII-1960 | During the Spanish colonial era, two land grants (Rancho Las Animas and Rancho San Ysidro) comprised what is now the region known as Gilroy. Additional land grants were issued during the Mexican era. The city of Gilroy was eventually named after a Scottish immigrant, John Cameron, who came to Monterey in 1814 and changed his name to Juan Bautista Gilroy after converting to Catholicism. He worked on Rancho San Ysidro, marrying the ranchero’s daughter Maria Clara Ortega, and became a naturalized Mexican citizen. Eventually he inherited a part of Rancho San Ysidro and raised cattle. During the American Period, Gilroy incorporated as a town (1868), and most of the Mexican rancho land passed into the hands of Anglo farmers and ranchers. In the late 1850s much of Rancho Los Animas (12,000 acres) was sold to Henry Miller, a famed cattleman in the Miller & Lux Company, which lobbied for the railroad to run through Gilroy in order to facilitate their cattle raising/butchering operations. The area boasted prune, cherry, and apricot orchards, with the producer exchange Sunsweet overseeing the drying of these crops for market. In the early 1960s, orchards were replaced by row crops of tomatoes, sugar beets, and garlic. | Prior to WWII, Mexican immigrants migrated to work in the orchards and fields, living temporarily on the ranches where they worked. Some Mexicans, such as the  García family who migrated from Texas, began moving into Gilroy during WWII. They initially bought a large apartment complex, the Guadalupe Apartments, on Eigelberry and 7th Street, and then opened the Post Office Market on 6th Street and Monterey Road, which they sold and then established García (card) Club in 1952 on Monterey Road between 6th and 7th Street facing the railroad. The Mexican businesses of the García family were unique. Gilroy was a small town, so there was not a separate Mexican business district, and Mexican residents did not attend separate schools or theaters. Instead Wednesday was “Mexican Night” at the Anglo-owned Strand Theater, with headliners such as Cantinflas appearing on occasion. | It was not until WWII and later that Mexicans moved into higher paid, unionized cannery work. Though still seasonal, it was flexible enough to allow workers to move to other jobs when necessary. Employment at the Felice and Perrelli Cannery (1914-1997) enabled several generations of Mexican families to establish roots in town. The Gilroy Mexican | Colonia | appeared south of 7th Street, with some settling on the westside of Monterey Road and the majority living east of Monterey Road next to the canneries and railroad tracks. | 2  of | 17 | Title: Enumeration District Maps for Santa Clara County, California | Date: 1930 - 1950 | Source: The U.S. National Archives | Link | https://catalog.archives.gov/ | Additional Online Information | Gilroy Historical Society | (see oral history interviews) | Immigrants Play Big Part in Gilroy History | The San José Mexican Downtown Colonia Before and After WWII | As more seasonal Mexican immigrant workers arrived in the Valley, civic leaders worried that a year-round Mexican settlement would lower Anglo property values. Between 1920 and 1945, racially/ethnically restrictive covenants (land deed restrictions) and racial/ethnic redlining (lender refusal to offer loans in certain areas) on housing in cities and towns were enacted. These reinforced the segregation of Mexican | colonias | like San José’s old Pueblo neighborhood, located next to the less desirable industrial area filled with canneries, packing houses and railroads. | As more seasonal Mexican immigrant workers arrived in the Valley, civic leaders worried that a In 1900, Mexican and ethnically white Portuguese, Spanish and Italians resided in the Downtown | Colonia. | When the number of Italians moving to the old Pueblo, between the 1880s to the 1920s, expanded beyond the housing capacity, they moved into the northern, western and southern adjacent neighborhood.  The southern neighborhood became known as “Goosetown”. Throughout California, Mexican | colonias | were pejoratively called \"Mexicantowns\" or \"Jimtowns\" (thus racially equating Mexicans to southern African Americans, who were subjected to Jim Crow laws).  Historian Suzanne Guerra notes, in the 1920s, the old Pueblo, referred to by Anglo Americans as “Mexicantown”, was hemmed in by urban development and adjacent orchards resulting in fewer places to live in San José.  Historian Gregorio Mora-Torres observes that by WWII, the Italian residents of the Downtown | Colonia | and “Goosetown” moved to other neighborhoods throughout the city.  WWII also enabled ethnic Mexicans to move up to higher paying, more stable jobs in the unionized canneries, so they bought the vacated Italian homes in the Downtown | Colonia. | During the 1940s, the Downtown | Colonia | expanded north to St. Augustine, south to San Carlos Street, and west beyond the Guadalupe River. By the late 1950s, it had reached all the way to Home/Virginia Streets. Mexicans also lived in the community north of Santa Clara Street and between Second Street and the Coyote River.  This spurred the development of Mexican owned businesses downtown to serve Spanish speaking residents in the region. | 3  of | 17 | Title: San José Sanborn Map 1915 annotated | Date: 1915 | Collection: California Room | Owning Institution: San José Public Library | Eastside San José | The area known as the Eastside San José was first settled by Puerto Ricans, who left low-paying Hawaiian canefield jobs during WWI for higher paid agricultural work in Santa Clara County.  Prior to WWII, concerned that Mexicans might move into their neighborhoods, Santa Clara County civic leaders imposed racial/ethnic restrictive covenants and endorsed redlining policies towards Mexicans.  This would concentrate the Mexican populations into the Downtown | Colonia | or the unincorporated Eastside. Mexican migrants and exiles from the Almaden Mine joined the Eastside Puerto Rican settlement in the early 1920s. These mineworkers wanted to be near other Spanish speakers as well as cannery and farm jobs. | In 1931 the Mayfair Packing Company, for which the Mayfair District is named,  was built on the Eastside and became one of eleven canneries and packing plants in San José. During WWII, ethnic whites left for higher paying munitions industry work and Mexican workers filled cannery jobs and settled there in large numbers. In 1955 the Mayfair District, nicknamed \" | Sal Sí Puedes | \" (Get Out If You Can-a name taken from an original Mexican landgrant), was home to 4,500 residents, of whom 3,000 were of Mexican descent. | The segregated Eastside provided empty lots for group camping, mobile rail housing, or long-term housing in apartments, boarding houses, and rental units. Families would often pool their money to purchase an unimproved lot where they could build their own homes. In this way, worker neighborhoods were created with a variety of owner-built housing. For decades the segregated Eastside area remained unimproved with no paved streets or street lights. | 4  of | 17 | Title: The Weekly Mayfair | Collection: History San Jose Online Catalog | Owning Institution: History San José Research Library | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/0653be5aee3055fe70dd9fe65b695326/ | Additional Online Information | East Side Dreams: The Untold Story of East San José | San Jose Public Library | Eastside Dreams: Highlighting the History of East San José | Community Segregation Policies | Similar to Southern California, ethnic Mexicans were subjected to social, residential and educational segregation throughout Santa Clara County.  According to a 1950 SJSU student study and a 1978 study done by the Garden City Women’s Club, ethnic Mexicans, African Americans and Asians experienced de facto segregation in policies regarding public pools, bowling alleys, and ballrooms and dancehalls. | Santa Clara County followed California’s segregationist housing policies, which also aligned with school segregation patterns. According to California law, segregated schools were built if a community had more than ten students of Native American, Chinese, Japanese or Mongolian ancestry and if these minority students’ parents petitioned a district to build one.  If the community had less than ten non-white students, these students would only be allowed to attend the community school if white parents approved.  If not, then these non-white students could not attend school. Students of Mexican ancestry were not included in California’s school segregation laws until their numbers increased by 1910 due to the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) pushing people out of México and the need for agricultural labor pulled Mexicans to the U.S. | Since many ethnic Mexican families migrated to new jobs every two to three months following the crops, their children’s school attendance could be sporadic. At that time, schools were divided between elementary (K-8) and high school (9-12). Since few employment opportunities existed outside of agriculture before WWII Mexican children were encouraged to work in order to supplement the family income or  drop out of school after the 8 | th | grade. After WWII, educational opportunities changed for ethnic Mexicans. Young people began attending high school and college, and skilled, higher paying jobs opened up to them. In post-war California, attitudes toward ethnic Mexicans slowly changed. Ethnic Mexican soldiers had become “brothers in arms” during the war as they fought in Anglo units, not segregated as African American soldiers had been.

The event started as The Rose Carnival in 1896 and became the | Fiesta de las Rosas | in 1926 and lasted until 1933. | In this instance, as historian Stephen Pitti notes, Anglo citizens connected their shared European white heritage with an imaginary Spanish-European California, an explicitly non-Mexican past. A few of the region’s remaining Californios were considered worthy of celebration, such as Santa Clara’s Encarnación Pinedo. Historian/journalist Carey McWilliams observed that the Anglo population considered these particular | Californios | to be the living embodiment of the “Spanish fantasy heritage.” | During the 1910s and 1920s, fiesta parades took place throughout California and were wildly popular, particularly in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara; some continue on today. Celebrations and theatrical performances using the themes of California’s mythical past were held throughout California in plays like “The Mission,'' by John S. McGroarty. | Santa Clara County hosted its first performance of “The Mission'' in 1915 at Santa Clara University. As PItti states, concerns over racial miscegenation and inter-racial romance were followed by two Fiesta plays that celebrated European White (Spanish or English) conquest over Mestizos and Indians, “La Rosa del Rancho, a Love Story of Early San José” (1927) and “The Madonna of Monterey” (1930). Anglos and ethnic whites played all the Spanish roles.  For the audience, these celebrations affirmed the dominance of white European culture over the darker skinned Mexican “peons,” who were securely marginalized. | 6  of | 17 | TItle: 1927 Souvenir of the Santa Clara County Second Annual Fiesta de las Rosas | Date: 1927-05 | Collection: Fiesta de las Rosas Collection | Owning Institution: San José Public Library, California Room | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/efc8cd7b4b1b14869244f43bc824d234/ | Additional Online Information | Fiesta de las Rosas Collection — Calisphere | “Fiesta De Las Rosas” | Fiesta De Las Rosas Parade - 1929 | Mexican Mutualistas, Home Clubs and La Comisión Honorifica in Santa Clara County | In Santa Clara County, immigrants formed associations with others from their original home in México or other regions of the Southwest.  In San José, historian Stephen Pitti describes the rise of “town clubs” as the fraternal twin of the Mexican American | mutualist | as, or mutual aid societies.  One important difference was that both men and women joined the town clubs while | mutualistas | were for men only.  In the late 1920s, town clubs and mutualistas both helped with life insurance and funeral expenses for those without funds, fostering “a sense of local identity” while maintaining cultural and nationalist connections to México. | Town clubs linked transplanted Mexican residents from similar hometowns that were now living in Santa Clara County.  These community organizations assisted families, developed community and promoted cultural events. They held social activities in local parks and residences to raise money to aid members and celebrate cultural ties, such as | Fiestas Patrias. | Most importantly, they advised newcomers in their native language on local laws, customs, and practices to help them integrate into American society. While Americanization programs were designed to replace immigrants’ native tongue and cultural traditions, town clubs and | mutualistas | aided immigrants in their transition to the new country. | Mutualistas | and town clubs strengthened links to the Mexican consulate and to México as well. Using these connections, the consulate encouraged repatriation to México for San José immigrants struggling in the U.S. during the Great Depression. The Mexican consulate in San Francisco worked with the | mutualistas | to promote Mexican national celebrations of the | Fiestas Patrias | and to aid Mexican citizens | . | During the Great Depression, the town clubs grew because it was impossible to afford annual visits to México as had been common in the 1920s. The California deportation campaign against ethnic Mexicans between 1929-1934 reinforced Northern California Mexicans’ reliance on their town clubs. | Prior to WWII and after, non-citizens were usually ineligible for social services. | Mutualistas | played an important role in redressing these inequities, advocating for their members with police and immigration authorities and granting small loans, as well as sponsoring local sporting events and cultural celebrations. The Mexican Consulate established the | Comisión Honorifica Mexicana, | an organization to promote cultural connections and aid Mexican citizens in the United States. The | Comisión | admitted all men of Mexican descent, regardless of citizenship. | 7  of | 17 | Title: Court of | Fiestas Patrias | , Trinidad de la Grande on the right | Date: 1940s | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, Trinidad de La Grande Martinez Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California (Mexican Americans) | Mutual Aid Societies in the Hispanic Southwest: Alternative Sources of Community Empowerment | “Mexican Americans and the Legacy of the Mutualista Movement” | “CHAPTER ONE” in “In Defense of La Raza: The Los Angeles Mexican Consulate and the Mexican Community, 1929 to 1936” on University of Arizona Press | The 1930s Deportation/Repatriation Campaign in San José | In Santa Clara County, Mexicans did not endure the same threats from the Klu Klux Klan that their compatriots in Southern California experienced in the 1920s. However, with the 1924 Immigration Act, pressure was put on the U.S. federal government to establish the first Mexican border patrol. | In Southern California, the Mexican Deportation Campaigns from 1929-1934 further limited immigration. Santa Clara County, however, did not conduct extensive deportation campaigns, although Anglo trade unions tried to do so during the Great Depression. Instead, the Mexican consulate promoted the idea of repatriation to México to help those Mexican nationals who were suffering from the  economic fallout from the Depression. As non-citizens, this population was ineligible for state or federal aid. During the 1930s, according to | History Unfolded | , 400,000-1 million of the nearly two million Mexicans living in the U.S., including American citizens, were either deported or repatriated to México. In San José, one third of the 4,000 Mexican residents chose to return to México in the Mexican government sponsored repatriation campaign. | 8  of | 17 | Title: Article on Repatriation | Date: 04 March 1933, Sat. p. 4 | Collection: Monrovia News-Post, Monrovia, CA | Source: | https://www.newspapers.com/clip/69883035/monrovia-news-post/ | Additional Online Information | Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California (Mexican Americans) | Invisible Borders: Repatriation and Colonization of Mexican Migrant Workers Along the California Borderlands During the 1930s | The Deportation-Repatriation Campaign Against La Raza | “Repatriation” of Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals continues | Mexican Communities in the Great Depression | Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice | INS Records for 1930s Mexican Repatriations | USCIS | Mexican Businesses in Downtown San José, WWII to 1960 | Historically, American settlement was concentrated east of the old Pueblo, with new businesses on 1st, 2nd and 3rd Streets.

Restrictive housing policies had created segregated neighborhoods, and it was commonly understood that public accommodations were racially restricted until the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. | Stores, restaurants, bars, and shops that served Mexican customers were located on Market Street or the portions of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd Streets south of Santa Clara Street. On weekends, Mexican workers from across the County congregated to do their weekly shopping, see a movie, or get a haircut. By 1960, Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals comprised one-fourth of Santa Clara County’s population and were a major factor in the regional economy. Urban redevelopment and freeway construction would displace a large number of residents of the Downtown | Colonia | , contributing to the closure of many Mexican businesses in the area. | 9  of | 17 | Title: Pantoja Family in Downtown San José | Date: 1955 | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, José Pantoja Family Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | San José's Downtown Historic District (U.S. National Park Service) | Do You Know the Way to San José?\" Ethnic Mexicans, Urbanism, Culture, and Politics in Emerging Silicon Valley | Mexican Entertainment in Downtown San José, WWII-1960 | Downtown San José was the regional social hub for Mexican residents. On weekends, locals were joined by farm workers from nearby rural regions of the San Joaquin Valley to eat at a Mexican restaurant, watch a Spanish-language movie, meet friends for a drink, or go dancing. | On Market Street a strip of restaurants and stores catered to a Mexican clientele.  After WWII, the Liberty Theater, the Victory, the Lyric, and the José offered first-run movies from México and staged personal appearances from singers and performers. Local ballrooms (see ballroom section) also enlivened the downtown social scene. The proximity of nightclubs, many Mexican restaurants  and shops that encouraged their patronage, was a major draw to those who had only limited services in their small communities or the work camps scattered throughout the region. | After WWII | El Eccentrico | , the local Spanish-language entertainment magazine, established in 1948 (running until 1980), carried ads for shops, grocers, restaurants, and real estate and insurance agents catering to a Mexican clientele.

From these influences came the polkas and accordion music that are so closely associated with this style. | Many of these Mexican immigrants were from rural areas, and more familiar with the Mexican | orquesta tipica, | or string band, and regional music from their homelands, such as the | conjunto | . The | conjunto | mixed the folksy storytelling | corrido | , the dance form | huapangos, | and the traditional | ranchera | with European instruments such as the accordion. In the borderlands of the American Southwest, the | orquesta Tejana | was patterned after the big bands of this period and appealed to an acculturated Mexican American audience.  A fusion of these styles with | mariachi | and rock-n-roll in the late 1950s would result in a new style referred to as | Tejano or Tex-Mex. | Mexican | corridos | , a popular music genre of the late 1920s to the mid 1940s, provided a way for ethnic Mexicans to document their immigration, migration, work and day-to-day living experiences.  Frontera music curator Juan Antonio Cuellar notes that | corridos | were a form of oral history documentation adapted to music | . | News headlines became | corridos | stories.  Cuellar describes corridos as “the newspapers of the Mexican working class”. | During the 1920s, Latin American music and performers became popular among elites of all continents, who often preferred simplified romantic ballads and Latinized American pop music. Both this “society rumba” and Afro-Cuban influenced Latin American music such as mambos, were popular with local Latino audiences for the next several decades. Out of the big band era arising in the mid 1930s through the 1940s, Mexican musicians added a Mexican twist and created | Pachuco Boogie | . | The largest events in San José were often held at the Municipal Auditorium, with performers such as Tito Puente, Desi Arnaz, and Lalo Guerrero playing for dances. Other ballrooms included The Balconades and The Palomar/Starlight ballrooms. | During the war years, big bands–such as Benny Goodman, Glen Miller, Xavier Cugat, Jimmy Dorsey, and Artie Shaw–all featured Latin songs. | In | the early 1950s, American bands playing the Latin rumba, including nightclub performers such as Xavier Cugat, Desi Arnaz, and Carmen Miranda, were often featured in movies and television. | 11  of | 17 | Title: Pérez Prado Band | Date: circa 1950 | Collection:  Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, Clay Shanrock Family Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | Corridos sin Fronteras | Smithsonian Music | Mexican Musicians in California and the United States, 1910-50 | Rumbo a California | San José Sabor:  Local Mexican Musicians, Singers, Bands and Radio Stations in San José, WWII to 1960 | San José gave rise to several nationally recognized musicians and singers, such as the Montoya Sisters from the Eastside. From the 1940s through the 1960s, Agustin De La Grande was an important performer who, through his | Academia de Musica | , mentored many aspiring local musicians and young people in his marching band and orchestra. Agustin taught his daughter Trinidad De La Grande Martínez as well. She learned to play several instruments and filled in positions in her father’s band when needed. Some of De La Grande’s students went on to form their own groups, like the Bernie Fuentes Band, the house band at the Palomar.  Low pay for performances forced many musicians to work during the day, many in the canneries, and perform in the evenings after work. This was the experience of musician Coronado Barrientes, drummer Rudy Coronado, and singer Francis Pacheco Wells. | By the 1950s, young Mexican Americans, like their peers, were attracted to the new musical styles of rhythm and blues and rock-n-roll. During this time, radio was becoming the prime source of Spanish-language entertainment and information for the expanding Mexican | colonias. | Many ethnic Mexicans could not afford to buy records or attend concerts, but they loved listening to music in public spaces that had jukeboxes or on the radio.  Several local radio stations developed Spanish programs, some of which were broadcast by Jesus Reyes Valenzuela, born in Shafter, Texas, and the first Spanish language broadcaster to operate in Santa Clara County. In the late 1940, his \" | Hora Artistica | \" was aired on KSJO Monday through Saturday. Mornings and afternoons featured the beloved singers of Mexican | rancheros | -- | Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, Luis Pérez Meza, Luis Aguilar, and Lola Beltran. Radio Station KAZA in Gilroy started in the 1950s or 1960s.  It was Portuguese owned and had 80% Spanish language programming, 7% Portuguese language programming and the remainder was English programming.  In the 1960s, radio stations began to feature live remote broadcasts from community events featuring local singers and musicians. | 12  of | 17 | Title: Exhibit De La Grande Colln_Agustin De La Grande Directing_other performers.tif | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, De La Grande Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Mexican Dancehalls, Lounges and Ballrooms | Public dance halls in the U.S. first appeared in urban areas around 1845, often as dance halls associated with the working classes, selling liquor or operating as saloons. In polite society, public dances were charity events, club or lodge dances, and held at dance palaces or pavilions associated with amusement parks. Providing  a new social setting where people could make new acquaintances and socialize with those of diverse backgrounds, while observing the latest trends and fashions, ballroom dancing altered social patterns between the sexes, different social classes, and different racial and ethnic groups at the turn of the 20th century. | With the growth of popular music and dancing came new neighborhood dance halls or private clubs. Public dance halls and pavilions, often offering dancing lessons, did not appear in local city directories until 1927. From 1927 to 1945, four main ballrooms were located in downtown San José: The Balconades on Santa Clara Street, The Rainbow Ballroom on San Antonio Street, The Majestic on Third Street, and The Palomar Gardens on Notre Dame Street. These offered music by varied racial/ethnic bands in front of an integrated audience, although a majority came from the same racial/ethnic group as the band playing.  In 1946, two other local venues were added: The Italia Hall, operated by Prospero G. López, and The Townsend Hall, owned by Frank and Angelo Boitano. These informal settings often catered to the non-Anglo working class and ethnic communities who could not afford, and often were not welcome, in the major ballrooms. In the late 1950s, John Zamora, a local Mexican businessman who had grown up as a farmworker and then went on to college, opened several restaurants with lounges where his musician brother Bobby Zamora and his band performed. | Music producers, such as Frank Davila, understood that the availability of both radios and record players to a wider audience helped to popularize new artists and sell records. While lounges and nightclubs offered an audience of 300-500 each night, large ballrooms might | attract 3000-5000 potential record buyers. These large venues were ideal for aspiring performers and big-name attractions with new albums. During the 1930s, large public dances and concerts were held at The San José Municipal Auditorium, offering traditional Mexican and “Spanish-American” music. According to public historian Suzanne Guerra, who did an historical context on the last surviving ballroom from the Big Band Era, The Palomar, constructed in 1946, was the only venue where an integrated audience could attend social dances and musical concerts in an elegant setting. | San José provided numerous performing venues. Although not as large a market as Los Angeles, the proximity to the Bay Area and the many small venues in Santa Clara County enabled musicians to supplement jobs in the canneries with weekend performances at dance halls and clubs. This was the experience of Francis Pacheco Wells, vocalist for Dan's Combo, performing on the weekends at Maria'a Cocktail Lounge (728 N. 13th St. San José). Family celebrations and community fundraising events were often held at ballrooms and public halls. Musical parties like the multigenerational | tardeada | reinforced family and community ties, with both traditional musical styles and contemporary music, food and entertainment for largely Spanish-speaking audiences. In this way, the mix of musical styles in San José was continually renewed with each wave of immigrants and their distinct musical traditions. | 13  of | 17 | Title: | EL Eccentríco | Date: August 1949 | Collection: | EL Eccentríco | Collection | Owning Institution: California Room, San José Public Library | Source: Calisphere | Additional Online Information | Hispanic Americans: Cultural Traditions and the People, 1930s-1960s — Calisphere | Arts in Context | Tardeadas | Season 3 | Episode 1 | PBS | The Palomar Ballroom | San Jose’s Zoot Suit Riots | The Zoot Suit Riots in 1943 were a series of violent clashes in Los Angeles between U.S. servicemen, off-duty police officers, and civilians who confronted young Latinos and other minorities. The riots took their name from the baggy zoot suits that accentuated their movements worn by many young men in the 1930s in dance halls in the East. The zoot suit became a popular trend among young men in African American, Mexican American, and other minority communities in California. Anglo Americans knew very little about the Mexican American community, who were generally portrayed by local police and newspapers as problematic lawbreakers, drunks, or criminals. Young Mexican Americans were portrayed as | pachucos | (juvenile delinquents) or gang members who posed a danger to society. | Conflicts between police and Mexican youths spread from L.A. to the Bay Area during the summer of 1943. In San José police carried out a similar harassment of Mexicans in the name of “keeping the peace.” In one instance, “intent on starting their own ‘zoot suit’ war,”  a group of sailors hunted down Mexican youths as they spilled out of the downtown dance halls and ballrooms on Market Street in the late hours of the night. Local Judge William James stated, that \"we certainly don’t want to see anything happen here like it is in Los Angeles,” handing down probation if the arrestee would join the military. | Large groups of assembled Mexican young men were often considered suspect. One night, two San José police officers tried to arrest two Mexicans having a fist fight in St. James Park.  The two escaped but were caught in front of a dance hall where a group of Mexican cannery workers and zoot suiters were just leaving. The group attacked others, who followed the officers and the youths back to the police station. When the youths fell and appeared injured, a large group of military and local police arrived to disperse the crowd. | At a local Santa Cruz beach, Marines drove visiting Mexicans away. Five Mexican young men were held in the San José Jail “because of their large size.” In 1944, 25 zoot suitors were arrested for “frequenting streets and public places in the late night,” and three of what the San José police considered “bad boys” were deported to México. That same year, Gilroy police arrested thirty Mexican youth “for violating curfew laws.” Toward the end of the War, another clash occurred between zoot suiters and sailors in St. James Park, the same location as the lynching of Tiburcio Vásquez in the late 1800s, ending with the arrest of the Mexican youths and release of the sailors. | 14  of | 17 | Title:  Kiki, Benny, Nando 1942 | Date: 1942 | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, The Fernando Chávez Family Collection | Owning Source: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | Zoot Suit Riots Begin in Los Angeles - HISTORY | Watch Zoot Suit Riots | American Experience | Official Site | PBS | 1942: People v.

Opened in 1947, the Palomar was the first integrated ballroom in San José, where big bands, vocalists, and jazz artists from across the country, México, Latin America, and the Caribbean performed in front of an integrated audience. | In 1956, Rock 'n' Roll was still new, and the big attraction that night was the now legendary Fats Domino, who arrived very late to a large crowd inside the ballroom and hundreds waiting outside. By the time the band started, some patrons were already drunk and unruly. During the intermission, beer bottles were thrown; then a brawl began as lights were smashed, chairs and tables destroyed, and many were injured. Nearly a dozen people were arrested. | Accounts of the brawl appeared in every major newspaper in the country, and the | San Francisco Chronicle | termed the affair a “Rock ‘n’ Roll Riot,” linking the music with the breakdown of public order. One week later the San José City Council considered a resolution to ban rock and roll at city-owned venues, eventually establishing a new ordinance requiring all drinks at concerts to be dispensed in paper cups. Just as the zoot suit had been used to criminalize youth of color in the 1940s, Rock ‘n’ Roll music was used to vilify another generation of ethnic young people. | 15  of | 17 | Title: Palomar Ticket Line | Source: San Jose MercuryNews | Public Domain | Additional Online Information | Ain't That a Shame : Thirty Years Ago, America Experienced Its First Rock 'n' Roll Riot. - Los Angeles Times | Rock 'n' Roll Riot in San Jose | Leisure Time with Social and Car Clubs | With non-agricultural jobs increasingly becoming available to ethnic Mexicans after WWII, more Mexican American youth began to attend high school and college. In the 1950s, a proliferation of social clubs, like Club Cuauhtémoc, provided a place for young ethnic Mexican urban professionals to gather. Some social clubs functioned similarly to town clubs, like The Del Rio Club, bringing together people from the same town or region. Some social clubs focused on public service, holding fundraisers for charitable causes or organizing around community issues such as voter registration and Latino candidates. Social clubs sponsored dances, such as the traditional formal Black and White Ball, organized outings such as picnics, or group activities, including bowling teams. | In the 1950s and later, lowriders in San José were mostly Latino, converting older cars for cruising, car shows, and design competition at events, adorning | their cars with Mexican American imagery and vibrant colors. | As small groups organized into regional clubs, lowriding became a multigenerational cultural activity, with the embellished car club jacket created to identify the local group.  These “jacket clubs” were popular in San José, though local police banned them from 1986 to 2022 on the basis of preventing gang violence and related crime. The intersection of Story and King in the Eastside is now recognized as the meeting ground for generations of Lowriders and San José as a center of Lowrider culture. | As the Mexican American community became more established, new organizations were formed, such as the Mexican American Chamber of Commerce and the Mexican Masonic Lodge. The number of social clubs, ethnic organizations and fraternal associations increased among the post-WWII growing Mexican middle class and young professionals, who announced their activities regularly in the bilingual, regional entertainment magazine | El Excentrico (FKA El Eccentríco | ).  Church groups, clubs, and organizations were also involved in charitable activities and community projects. | Social clubs, sporting events, baseball and basketball clubs, and car clubs promoted ethnic consciousness, built solidarity, and sharpened organizing and leadership skills. They offered young Mexican Americans opportunities to compete on an equal basis outside the immigrant community. Such cultural activities generated networks, created bonds of solidarity, and provided a strong foundation for the Mexican civil rights movement to emerge within a flourishing community of musicians, artists, sportsmen, and club members. | 16  of | 17 | Title:  Bernie Fuentes Band, Club Cuauhtémoc Social Dance | Date: 1950s | Collection:  Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, Brooks Family Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | East Side Revelations - Lowriding | San José Public Library | After a Decades-Long Ban, San José's Lowriders Are Ready to Cruise Again - Atlas Obscura | Recreation at Parks, Churches, Beaches, Mountains and Beyond | Local parks were popular sites for large family gatherings and youth activities. During the post-WWII period, there were few parks or recreation centers in Mexican neighborhoods. Families might host small groups at home but had to travel to parks like Alum Rock to host larger groups. With the lack of neighborhood parks, the Catholic church often filled the gap by providing a place for recreational activities and community events. Catholic churches became important public spaces, with social halls used for family or community events, art programs, English classes, and neighborhood meetings. Leaders in these Catholic churches often moved on into positions of influence in labor movements and political organizations. | While the majority of ethnic Mexicans in Santa Clara County identified as Catholics, there were also Mexican Baptists, as well as Presbyterians, Methodists, and various evangelical denominations. While Mexican cultural traditions were acknowledged, many churches sponsored youth baseball and basketball teams in order to engage immigrant families in American culture and recreation. Neighborhood schools also offered organized sports. | During the post-war years, automobiles became more affordable, and families began to travel longer distances to | the beach and Boardwalk in Santa Cruz, to camp or hike in the redwoods or Mt. Hamilton, tour San Francisco, or even vacation in México. | 17  of | 17 | Title: Fernando Chavez and Friends at Alum Rock Park | Date: 1950s | Collection:  Before Silicon Valley Project Archives, Fernando Chávez Family Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | American Latino Theme Study: Sports (U.S. National Park Service) | Previous | Next | The Mountain View Colonia, WWII-1960 | The Hispanic roots of Mountain View stretch back to the Mexican land grant of Rancho Pastoria de Las Borregas of 8,800 acres that included lands in current Sunnyvale and Mountain View,  granted to Francisco Estrada and his wife Inez in 1842. When the Estradas died in 1845 they left their land to Inez’s father, Mariano Castro. Castro sold the eastern half of the rancho, what is now Sunnyvale, to Irishman Martin Murphy, Jr.  Murphy had arrived in 1844 and  planted Santa Clara County’s first orchard on his newly acquired land. Castro died in 1856, leaving the Mountain View portion to his son, Crisanto Castro. Like other Mexican | Californios | , the Castros fought in the American courts from 1852 to 1871 to validate their land grants but lost most of it to squatters and lawyers fees. The Castro family remained in Mountain View until 1958, when they sold their remaining 23.5 acres to the City of Mountain View. | In the early 1900s Spanish immigrants arrived in Santa Clara County. Many who had worked in the orchards and canneries in the 1920s and 1930s moved to Mountain View, California, settling in the northern section of the city above the canneries, packinghouses and  railroads. These included the Mountain View Fruit Packing Company, Clark Canning, and San José Fruit Preserving Company.  Around 1920, the P.L. Sanguinetti Cannery in Mountain View was acquired by the Richmond-Chase Cannery, one of the largest in California. | Sharing a common language, the Spanish community welcomed Mexican immigrants who arrived in Mountain View during and after WWII. This would eventually transform the Spanish neighborhood into the Mountain View Mexican | Colonia | .  In such a small town, Mexicans did | not form a separate commercial district but melded cultural traditions and a shared language.   St. Joseph Catholic Church became the heart of the | C | olonia | , and during the late 1940s to 1950 Father Donald McDonnell encouraged the Mexican community to address their financial, economic, and social needs by creating Club Estrella as well as a community credit union. Club Estrella hosted annual church and community events for the entire Spanish speaking community.  Increasing urbanization and highway expansion during the 1950s and 1960s brought major thoroughfares through the heart of the district and decimated the established Mountain View | C | olonia | .  Father McDonnell was assigned to the Mexican mission in Eastside San José in 1951, and helped establish the San José de Guadalupe Church and became a mentor to César Chávez. | Title/Caption:  Father Donald McDonnell, Parish Priest in Mountain View 1947 | Date: 1947 | Collection: Nick Perry Family Collection | Owning Institution: Mountain View Historical Association | Source: Mountain View Public Library | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | Castro Family Timeline | The Birth and Breaking of a Forgotten Community | Bittersweet: Memories of Old Mountain View | Mountain View Photographs & Oral Histories (Includes Mexican Worker Interview) | Mountain View Public Library History Page | The Gilroy Colonia, WWII-1960 | During the Spanish colonial era, two land grants (Rancho Las Animas and Rancho San Ysidro) comprised what is now the region known as Gilroy. Additional land grants were issued during the Mexican era. The city of Gilroy was eventually named after a Scottish immigrant, John Cameron, who came to Monterey in 1814 and changed his name to Juan Bautista Gilroy after converting to Catholicism. He worked on Rancho San Ysidro, marrying the ranchero’s daughter Maria Clara Ortega, and became a naturalized Mexican citizen. Eventually he inherited a part of Rancho San Ysidro and raised cattle. During the American Period, Gilroy incorporated as a town (1868), and most of the Mexican rancho land passed into the hands of Anglo farmers and ranchers. In the late 1850s much of Rancho Los Animas (12,000 acres) was sold to Henry Miller, a famed cattleman in the Miller & Lux Company, which lobbied for the railroad to run through Gilroy in order to facilitate their cattle raising/butchering operations. The area boasted prune, cherry, and apricot orchards, with the producer exchange Sunsweet overseeing the drying of these crops for market. In the early 1960s, orchards were replaced by row crops of tomatoes, sugar beets, and garlic. | Prior to WWII, Mexican immigrants migrated to work in the orchards and fields, living temporarily on the ranches where they worked. Some Mexicans, such as the  García family who migrated from Texas, began moving into Gilroy during WWII. They initially bought a large apartment complex, the Guadalupe Apartments, on Eigelberry and 7th Street, and then opened the Post Office Market on 6th Street and Monterey Road, which they sold and then established García (card) Club in 1952 on Monterey Road between 6th and 7th Street facing the railroad. The Mexican businesses of the García family were unique. Gilroy was a small town, so there was not a separate Mexican business district, and Mexican residents did not attend separate schools or theaters. Instead Wednesday was “Mexican Night” at the Anglo-owned Strand Theater, with headliners such as Cantinflas appearing on occasion. | It was not until WWII and later that Mexicans moved into higher paid, unionized cannery work. Though still seasonal, it was flexible enough to allow workers to move to other jobs when necessary. Employment at the Felice and Perrelli Cannery (1914-1997) enabled several generations of Mexican families to establish roots in town. The Gilroy Mexican | Colonia | appeared south of 7th Street, with some settling on the westside of Monterey Road and the majority living east of Monterey Road next to the canneries and railroad tracks. | Title: Enumeration District Maps for Santa Clara County, California | Date: 1930 - 1950 | Source: The U.S. National Archives | Link | https://catalog.archives.gov/ | Additional Online Information | Gilroy Historical Society | (see oral history interviews) | Immigrants Play Big Part in Gilroy History | The San José Mexican Downtown Colonia Before and After WWII | As more seasonal Mexican immigrant workers arrived in the Valley, civic leaders worried that a year-round Mexican settlement would lower Anglo property values. Between 1920 and 1945, racially/ethnically restrictive covenants (land deed restrictions) and racial/ethnic redlining (lender refusal to offer loans in certain areas) on housing in cities and towns were enacted. These reinforced the segregation of Mexican | colonias | like San José’s old Pueblo neighborhood, located next to the less desirable industrial area filled with canneries, packing houses and railroads. | As more seasonal Mexican immigrant workers arrived in the Valley, civic leaders worried that a In 1900, Mexican and ethnically white Portuguese, Spanish and Italians resided in the Downtown | Colonia. | When the number of Italians moving to the old Pueblo, between the 1880s to the 1920s, expanded beyond the housing capacity, they moved into the northern, western and southern adjacent neighborhood.  The southern neighborhood became known as “Goosetown”. Throughout California, Mexican | colonias | were pejoratively called \"Mexicantowns\" or \"Jimtowns\" (thus racially equating Mexicans to southern African Americans, who were subjected to Jim Crow laws).  Historian Suzanne Guerra notes, in the 1920s, the old Pueblo, referred to by Anglo Americans as “Mexicantown”, was hemmed in by urban development and adjacent orchards resulting in fewer places to live in San José.  Historian Gregorio Mora-Torres observes that by WWII, the Italian residents of the Downtown | Colonia | and “Goosetown” moved to other neighborhoods throughout the city.  WWII also enabled ethnic Mexicans to move up to higher paying, more stable jobs in the unionized canneries, so they bought the vacated Italian homes in the Downtown | Colonia. | During the 1940s, the Downtown | Colonia | expanded north to St. Augustine, south to San Carlos Street, and west beyond the Guadalupe River. By the late 1950s, it had reached all the way to Home/Virginia Streets. Mexicans also lived in the community north of Santa Clara Street and between Second Street and the Coyote River.  This spurred the development of Mexican owned businesses downtown to serve Spanish speaking residents in the region. | Title: San José Sanborn Map 1915 annotated | Date: 1915 | Collection: California Room | Owning Institution: San José Public Library | Eastside San José | The area known as the Eastside San José was first settled by Puerto Ricans, who left low-paying Hawaiian canefield jobs during WWI for higher paid agricultural work in Santa Clara County.  Prior to WWII, concerned that Mexicans might move into their neighborhoods, Santa Clara County civic leaders imposed racial/ethnic restrictive covenants and endorsed redlining policies towards Mexicans.  This would concentrate the Mexican populations into the Downtown | Colonia | or the unincorporated Eastside. Mexican migrants and exiles from the Almaden Mine joined the Eastside Puerto Rican settlement in the early 1920s. These mineworkers wanted to be near other Spanish speakers as well as cannery and farm jobs. | In 1931 the Mayfair Packing Company, for which the Mayfair District is named,  was built on the Eastside and became one of eleven canneries and packing plants in San José. During WWII, ethnic whites left for higher paying munitions industry work and Mexican workers filled cannery jobs and settled there in large numbers. In 1955 the Mayfair District, nicknamed \" | Sal Sí Puedes | \" (Get Out If You Can-a name taken from an original Mexican landgrant), was home to 4,500 residents, of whom 3,000 were of Mexican descent. | The segregated Eastside provided empty lots for group camping, mobile rail housing, or long-term housing in apartments, boarding houses, and rental units. Families would often pool their money to purchase an unimproved lot where they could build their own homes. In this way, worker neighborhoods were created with a variety of owner-built housing. For decades the segregated Eastside area remained unimproved with no paved streets or street lights. | Title: The Weekly Mayfair | Collection: History San Jose Online Catalog | Owning Institution: History San José Research Library | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/0653be5aee3055fe70dd9fe65b695326/ | Additional Online Information | East Side Dreams: The Untold Story of East San José | San Jose Public Library | Eastside Dreams: Highlighting the History of East San José | Community Segregation Policies | Similar to Southern California, ethnic Mexicans were subjected to social, residential and educational segregation throughout Santa Clara County.  According to a 1950 SJSU student study and a 1978 study done by the Garden City Women’s Club, ethnic Mexicans, African Americans and Asians experienced de facto segregation in policies regarding public pools, bowling alleys, and ballrooms and dancehalls. | Santa Clara County followed California’s segregationist housing policies, which also aligned with school segregation patterns. According to California law, segregated schools were built if a community had more than ten students of Native American, Chinese, Japanese or Mongolian ancestry and if these minority students’ parents petitioned a district to build one.  If the community had less than ten non-white students, these students would only be allowed to attend the community school if white parents approved.  If not, then these non-white students could not attend school. Students of Mexican ancestry were not included in California’s school segregation laws until their numbers increased by 1910 due to the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) pushing people out of México and the need for agricultural labor pulled Mexicans to the U.S. | Since many ethnic Mexican families migrated to new jobs every two to three months following the crops, their children’s school attendance could be sporadic. At that time, schools were divided between elementary (K-8) and high school (9-12). Since few employment opportunities existed outside of agriculture before WWII Mexican children were encouraged to work in order to supplement the family income or  drop out of school after the 8 | th | grade. After WWII, educational opportunities changed for ethnic Mexicans. Young people began attending high school and college, and skilled, higher paying jobs opened up to them. In post-war California, attitudes toward ethnic Mexicans slowly changed. Ethnic Mexican soldiers had become “brothers in arms” during the war as they fought in Anglo units, not segregated as African American soldiers had been.

The event started as The Rose Carnival in 1896 and became the | Fiesta de las Rosas | in 1926 and lasted until 1933. | In this instance, as historian Stephen Pitti notes, Anglo citizens connected their shared European white heritage with an imaginary Spanish-European California, an explicitly non-Mexican past. A few of the region’s remaining Californios were considered worthy of celebration, such as Santa Clara’s Encarnación Pinedo. Historian/journalist Carey McWilliams observed that the Anglo population considered these particular | Californios | to be the living embodiment of the “Spanish fantasy heritage.” | During the 1910s and 1920s, fiesta parades took place throughout California and were wildly popular, particularly in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara; some continue on today. Celebrations and theatrical performances using the themes of California’s mythical past were held throughout California in plays like “The Mission,'' by John S. McGroarty. | Santa Clara County hosted its first performance of “The Mission'' in 1915 at Santa Clara University. As PItti states, concerns over racial miscegenation and inter-racial romance were followed by two Fiesta plays that celebrated European White (Spanish or English) conquest over Mestizos and Indians, “La Rosa del Rancho, a Love Story of Early San José” (1927) and “The Madonna of Monterey” (1930). Anglos and ethnic whites played all the Spanish roles.  For the audience, these celebrations affirmed the dominance of white European culture over the darker skinned Mexican “peons,” who were securely marginalized. | TItle: 1927 Souvenir of the Santa Clara County Second Annual Fiesta de las Rosas | Date: 1927-05 | Collection: Fiesta de las Rosas Collection | Owning Institution: San José Public Library, California Room | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/efc8cd7b4b1b14869244f43bc824d234/ | Additional Online Information | Fiesta de las Rosas Collection — Calisphere | “Fiesta De Las Rosas” | Fiesta De Las Rosas Parade - 1929 | Mexican Mutualistas, Home Clubs and La Comisión Honorifica in Santa Clara County | In Santa Clara County, immigrants formed associations with others from their original home in México or other regions of the Southwest.  In San José, historian Stephen Pitti describes the rise of “town clubs” as the fraternal twin of the Mexican American | mutualist | as, or mutual aid societies.  One important difference was that both men and women joined the town clubs while | mutualistas | were for men only.  In the late 1920s, town clubs and mutualistas both helped with life insurance and funeral expenses for those without funds, fostering “a sense of local identity” while maintaining cultural and nationalist connections to México. | Town clubs linked transplanted Mexican residents from similar hometowns that were now living in Santa Clara County.  These community organizations assisted families, developed community and promoted cultural events. They held social activities in local parks and residences to raise money to aid members and celebrate cultural ties, such as | Fiestas Patrias. | Most importantly, they advised newcomers in their native language on local laws, customs, and practices to help them integrate into American society. While Americanization programs were designed to replace immigrants’ native tongue and cultural traditions, town clubs and | mutualistas | aided immigrants in their transition to the new country. | Mutualistas | and town clubs strengthened links to the Mexican consulate and to México as well. Using these connections, the consulate encouraged repatriation to México for San José immigrants struggling in the U.S. during the Great Depression. The Mexican consulate in San Francisco worked with the | mutualistas | to promote Mexican national celebrations of the | Fiestas Patrias | and to aid Mexican citizens | . | During the Great Depression, the town clubs grew because it was impossible to afford annual visits to México as had been common in the 1920s. The California deportation campaign against ethnic Mexicans between 1929-1934 reinforced Northern California Mexicans’ reliance on their town clubs. | Prior to WWII and after, non-citizens were usually ineligible for social services. | Mutualistas | played an important role in redressing these inequities, advocating for their members with police and immigration authorities and granting small loans, as well as sponsoring local sporting events and cultural celebrations. The Mexican Consulate established the | Comisión Honorifica Mexicana, | an organization to promote cultural connections and aid Mexican citizens in the United States. The | Comisión | admitted all men of Mexican descent, regardless of citizenship. | Title: Court of | Fiestas Patrias | , Trinidad de la Grande on the right | Date: 1940s | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, Trinidad de La Grande Martinez Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California (Mexican Americans) | Mutual Aid Societies in the Hispanic Southwest: Alternative Sources of Community Empowerment | “Mexican Americans and the Legacy of the Mutualista Movement” | “CHAPTER ONE” in “In Defense of La Raza: The Los Angeles Mexican Consulate and the Mexican Community, 1929 to 1936” on University of Arizona Press | The 1930s Deportation/Repatriation Campaign in San José | In Santa Clara County, Mexicans did not endure the same threats from the Klu Klux Klan that their compatriots in Southern California experienced in the 1920s. However, with the 1924 Immigration Act, pressure was put on the U.S. federal government to establish the first Mexican border patrol. | In Southern California, the Mexican Deportation Campaigns from 1929-1934 further limited immigration. Santa Clara County, however, did not conduct extensive deportation campaigns, although Anglo trade unions tried to do so during the Great Depression. Instead, the Mexican consulate promoted the idea of repatriation to México to help those Mexican nationals who were suffering from the  economic fallout from the Depression. As non-citizens, this population was ineligible for state or federal aid. During the 1930s, according to | History Unfolded | , 400,000-1 million of the nearly two million Mexicans living in the U.S., including American citizens, were either deported or repatriated to México. In San José, one third of the 4,000 Mexican residents chose to return to México in the Mexican government sponsored repatriation campaign. | Title: Article on Repatriation | Date: 04 March 1933, Sat. p. 4 | Collection: Monrovia News-Post, Monrovia, CA | Source: | https://www.newspapers.com/clip/69883035/monrovia-news-post/ | Additional Online Information | Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California (Mexican Americans) | Invisible Borders: Repatriation and Colonization of Mexican Migrant Workers Along the California Borderlands During the 1930s | The Deportation-Repatriation Campaign Against La Raza | “Repatriation” of Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals continues | Mexican Communities in the Great Depression | Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice | INS Records for 1930s Mexican Repatriations | USCIS | Mexican Businesses in Downtown San José, WWII to 1960 | Historically, American settlement was concentrated east of the old Pueblo, with new businesses on 1st, 2nd and 3rd Streets.

Restrictive housing policies had created segregated neighborhoods, and it was commonly understood that public accommodations were racially restricted until the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. | Stores, restaurants, bars, and shops that served Mexican customers were located on Market Street or the portions of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd Streets south of Santa Clara Street. On weekends, Mexican workers from across the County congregated to do their weekly shopping, see a movie, or get a haircut. By 1960, Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals comprised one-fourth of Santa Clara County’s population and were a major factor in the regional economy. Urban redevelopment and freeway construction would displace a large number of residents of the Downtown | Colonia | , contributing to the closure of many Mexican businesses in the area. | Title: Pantoja Family in Downtown San José | Date: 1955 | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, José Pantoja Family Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | San José's Downtown Historic District (U.S. National Park Service) | Do You Know the Way to San José?\" Ethnic Mexicans, Urbanism, Culture, and Politics in Emerging Silicon Valley | Mexican Entertainment in Downtown San José, WWII-1960 | Downtown San José was the regional social hub for Mexican residents. On weekends, locals were joined by farm workers from nearby rural regions of the San Joaquin Valley to eat at a Mexican restaurant, watch a Spanish-language movie, meet friends for a drink, or go dancing. | On Market Street a strip of restaurants and stores catered to a Mexican clientele.  After WWII, the Liberty Theater, the Victory, the Lyric, and the José offered first-run movies from México and staged personal appearances from singers and performers. Local ballrooms (see ballroom section) also enlivened the downtown social scene. The proximity of nightclubs, many Mexican restaurants  and shops that encouraged their patronage, was a major draw to those who had only limited services in their small communities or the work camps scattered throughout the region. | After WWII | El Eccentrico | , the local Spanish-language entertainment magazine, established in 1948 (running until 1980), carried ads for shops, grocers, restaurants, and real estate and insurance agents catering to a Mexican clientele.

From these influences came the polkas and accordion music that are so closely associated with this style. | Many of these Mexican immigrants were from rural areas, and more familiar with the Mexican | orquesta tipica, | or string band, and regional music from their homelands, such as the | conjunto | . The | conjunto | mixed the folksy storytelling | corrido | , the dance form | huapangos, | and the traditional | ranchera | with European instruments such as the accordion. In the borderlands of the American Southwest, the | orquesta Tejana | was patterned after the big bands of this period and appealed to an acculturated Mexican American audience.  A fusion of these styles with | mariachi | and rock-n-roll in the late 1950s would result in a new style referred to as | Tejano or Tex-Mex. | Mexican | corridos | , a popular music genre of the late 1920s to the mid 1940s, provided a way for ethnic Mexicans to document their immigration, migration, work and day-to-day living experiences.  Frontera music curator Juan Antonio Cuellar notes that | corridos | were a form of oral history documentation adapted to music | . | News headlines became | corridos | stories.  Cuellar describes corridos as “the newspapers of the Mexican working class”. | During the 1920s, Latin American music and performers became popular among elites of all continents, who often preferred simplified romantic ballads and Latinized American pop music. Both this “society rumba” and Afro-Cuban influenced Latin American music such as mambos, were popular with local Latino audiences for the next several decades. Out of the big band era arising in the mid 1930s through the 1940s, Mexican musicians added a Mexican twist and created | Pachuco Boogie | . | The largest events in San José were often held at the Municipal Auditorium, with performers such as Tito Puente, Desi Arnaz, and Lalo Guerrero playing for dances. Other ballrooms included The Balconades and The Palomar/Starlight ballrooms. | During the war years, big bands–such as Benny Goodman, Glen Miller, Xavier Cugat, Jimmy Dorsey, and Artie Shaw–all featured Latin songs. | In | the early 1950s, American bands playing the Latin rumba, including nightclub performers such as Xavier Cugat, Desi Arnaz, and Carmen Miranda, were often featured in movies and television. | Title: Pérez Prado Band | Date: circa 1950 | Collection:  Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, Clay Shanrock Family Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | Corridos sin Fronteras | Smithsonian Music | Mexican Musicians in California and the United States, 1910-50 | Rumbo a California | San José Sabor:  Local Mexican Musicians, Singers, Bands and Radio Stations in San José, WWII to 1960 | San José gave rise to several nationally recognized musicians and singers, such as the Montoya Sisters from the Eastside. From the 1940s through the 1960s, Agustin De La Grande was an important performer who, through his | Academia de Musica | , mentored many aspiring local musicians and young people in his marching band and orchestra. Agustin taught his daughter Trinidad De La Grande Martínez as well. She learned to play several instruments and filled in positions in her father’s band when needed. Some of De La Grande’s students went on to form their own groups, like the Bernie Fuentes Band, the house band at the Palomar.  Low pay for performances forced many musicians to work during the day, many in the canneries, and perform in the evenings after work. This was the experience of musician Coronado Barrientes, drummer Rudy Coronado, and singer Francis Pacheco Wells. | By the 1950s, young Mexican Americans, like their peers, were attracted to the new musical styles of rhythm and blues and rock-n-roll. During this time, radio was becoming the prime source of Spanish-language entertainment and information for the expanding Mexican | colonias. | Many ethnic Mexicans could not afford to buy records or attend concerts, but they loved listening to music in public spaces that had jukeboxes or on the radio.  Several local radio stations developed Spanish programs, some of which were broadcast by Jesus Reyes Valenzuela, born in Shafter, Texas, and the first Spanish language broadcaster to operate in Santa Clara County. In the late 1940, his \" | Hora Artistica | \" was aired on KSJO Monday through Saturday. Mornings and afternoons featured the beloved singers of Mexican | rancheros | -- | Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, Luis Pérez Meza, Luis Aguilar, and Lola Beltran. Radio Station KAZA in Gilroy started in the 1950s or 1960s.  It was Portuguese owned and had 80% Spanish language programming, 7% Portuguese language programming and the remainder was English programming.  In the 1960s, radio stations began to feature live remote broadcasts from community events featuring local singers and musicians. | Title: Exhibit De La Grande Colln_Agustin De La Grande Directing_other performers.tif | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, De La Grande Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Mexican Dancehalls, Lounges and Ballrooms | Public dance halls in the U.S. first appeared in urban areas around 1845, often as dance halls associated with the working classes, selling liquor or operating as saloons. In polite society, public dances were charity events, club or lodge dances, and held at dance palaces or pavilions associated with amusement parks. Providing  a new social setting where people could make new acquaintances and socialize with those of diverse backgrounds, while observing the latest trends and fashions, ballroom dancing altered social patterns between the sexes, different social classes, and different racial and ethnic groups at the turn of the 20th century. | With the growth of popular music and dancing came new neighborhood dance halls or private clubs. Public dance halls and pavilions, often offering dancing lessons, did not appear in local city directories until 1927. From 1927 to 1945, four main ballrooms were located in downtown San José: The Balconades on Santa Clara Street, The Rainbow Ballroom on San Antonio Street, The Majestic on Third Street, and The Palomar Gardens on Notre Dame Street. These offered music by varied racial/ethnic bands in front of an integrated audience, although a majority came from the same racial/ethnic group as the band playing.  In 1946, two other local venues were added: The Italia Hall, operated by Prospero G. López, and The Townsend Hall, owned by Frank and Angelo Boitano. These informal settings often catered to the non-Anglo working class and ethnic communities who could not afford, and often were not welcome, in the major ballrooms. In the late 1950s, John Zamora, a local Mexican businessman who had grown up as a farmworker and then went on to college, opened several restaurants with lounges where his musician brother Bobby Zamora and his band performed. | Music producers, such as Frank Davila, understood that the availability of both radios and record players to a wider audience helped to popularize new artists and sell records. While lounges and nightclubs offered an audience of 300-500 each night, large ballrooms might | attract 3000-5000 potential record buyers. These large venues were ideal for aspiring performers and big-name attractions with new albums. During the 1930s, large public dances and concerts were held at The San José Municipal Auditorium, offering traditional Mexican and “Spanish-American” music. According to public historian Suzanne Guerra, who did an historical context on the last surviving ballroom from the Big Band Era, The Palomar, constructed in 1946, was the only venue where an integrated audience could attend social dances and musical concerts in an elegant setting. | San José provided numerous performing venues. Although not as large a market as Los Angeles, the proximity to the Bay Area and the many small venues in Santa Clara County enabled musicians to supplement jobs in the canneries with weekend performances at dance halls and clubs. This was the experience of Francis Pacheco Wells, vocalist for Dan's Combo, performing on the weekends at Maria'a Cocktail Lounge (728 N. 13th St. San José). Family celebrations and community fundraising events were often held at ballrooms and public halls. Musical parties like the multigenerational | tardeada | reinforced family and community ties, with both traditional musical styles and contemporary music, food and entertainment for largely Spanish-speaking audiences. In this way, the mix of musical styles in San José was continually renewed with each wave of immigrants and their distinct musical traditions. | Title: | EL Eccentríco | Date: August 1949 | Collection: | EL Eccentríco | Collection | Owning Institution: California Room, San José Public Library | Source: Calisphere | Additional Online Information | Hispanic Americans: Cultural Traditions and the People, 1930s-1960s — Calisphere | Arts in Context | Tardeadas | Season 3 | Episode 1 | PBS | The Palomar Ballroom | San Jose’s Zoot Suit Riots | The Zoot Suit Riots in 1943 were a series of violent clashes in Los Angeles between U.S. servicemen, off-duty police officers, and civilians who confronted young Latinos and other minorities. The riots took their name from the baggy zoot suits that accentuated their movements worn by many young men in the 1930s in dance halls in the East. The zoot suit became a popular trend among young men in African American, Mexican American, and other minority communities in California. Anglo Americans knew very little about the Mexican American community, who were generally portrayed by local police and newspapers as problematic lawbreakers, drunks, or criminals. Young Mexican Americans were portrayed as | pachucos | (juvenile delinquents) or gang members who posed a danger to society. | Conflicts between police and Mexican youths spread from L.A. to the Bay Area during the summer of 1943. In San José police carried out a similar harassment of Mexicans in the name of “keeping the peace.” In one instance, “intent on starting their own ‘zoot suit’ war,”  a group of sailors hunted down Mexican youths as they spilled out of the downtown dance halls and ballrooms on Market Street in the late hours of the night. Local Judge William James stated, that \"we certainly don’t want to see anything happen here like it is in Los Angeles,” handing down probation if the arrestee would join the military. | Large groups of assembled Mexican young men were often considered suspect. One night, two San José police officers tried to arrest two Mexicans having a fist fight in St. James Park.  The two escaped but were caught in front of a dance hall where a group of Mexican cannery workers and zoot suiters were just leaving. The group attacked others, who followed the officers and the youths back to the police station. When the youths fell and appeared injured, a large group of military and local police arrived to disperse the crowd. | At a local Santa Cruz beach, Marines drove visiting Mexicans away. Five Mexican young men were held in the San José Jail “because of their large size.” In 1944, 25 zoot suitors were arrested for “frequenting streets and public places in the late night,” and three of what the San José police considered “bad boys” were deported to México. That same year, Gilroy police arrested thirty Mexican youth “for violating curfew laws.” Toward the end of the War, another clash occurred between zoot suiters and sailors in St. James Park, the same location as the lynching of Tiburcio Vásquez in the late 1800s, ending with the arrest of the Mexican youths and release of the sailors. | Title:  Kiki, Benny, Nando 1942 | Date: 1942 | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, The Fernando Chávez Family Collection | Owning Source: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | Zoot Suit Riots Begin in Los Angeles - HISTORY | Watch Zoot Suit Riots | American Experience | Official Site | PBS | 1942: People v.

Opened in 1947, the Palomar was the first integrated ballroom in San José, where big bands, vocalists, and jazz artists from across the country, México, Latin America, and the Caribbean performed in front of an integrated audience. | In 1956, Rock 'n' Roll was still new, and the big attraction that night was the now legendary Fats Domino, who arrived very late to a large crowd inside the ballroom and hundreds waiting outside. By the time the band started, some patrons were already drunk and unruly. During the intermission, beer bottles were thrown; then a brawl began as lights were smashed, chairs and tables destroyed, and many were injured. Nearly a dozen people were arrested. | Accounts of the brawl appeared in every major newspaper in the country, and the | San Francisco Chronicle | termed the affair a “Rock ‘n’ Roll Riot,” linking the music with the breakdown of public order. One week later the San José City Council considered a resolution to ban rock and roll at city-owned venues, eventually establishing a new ordinance requiring all drinks at concerts to be dispensed in paper cups. Just as the zoot suit had been used to criminalize youth of color in the 1940s, Rock ‘n’ Roll music was used to vilify another generation of ethnic young people. | Title: Palomar Ticket Line | Source: San Jose MercuryNews | Public Domain | Additional Online Information | Ain't That a Shame : Thirty Years Ago, America Experienced Its First Rock 'n' Roll Riot. - Los Angeles Times | Rock 'n' Roll Riot in San Jose | Leisure Time with Social and Car Clubs | With non-agricultural jobs increasingly becoming available to ethnic Mexicans after WWII, more Mexican American youth began to attend high school and college. In the 1950s, a proliferation of social clubs, like Club Cuauhtémoc, provided a place for young ethnic Mexican urban professionals to gather. Some social clubs functioned similarly to town clubs, like The Del Rio Club, bringing together people from the same town or region. Some social clubs focused on public service, holding fundraisers for charitable causes or organizing around community issues such as voter registration and Latino candidates. Social clubs sponsored dances, such as the traditional formal Black and White Ball, organized outings such as picnics, or group activities, including bowling teams. | In the 1950s and later, lowriders in San José were mostly Latino, converting older cars for cruising, car shows, and design competition at events, adorning | their cars with Mexican American imagery and vibrant colors. | As small groups organized into regional clubs, lowriding became a multigenerational cultural activity, with the embellished car club jacket created to identify the local group.  These “jacket clubs” were popular in San José, though local police banned them from 1986 to 2022 on the basis of preventing gang violence and related crime. The intersection of Story and King in the Eastside is now recognized as the meeting ground for generations of Lowriders and San José as a center of Lowrider culture. | As the Mexican American community became more established, new organizations were formed, such as the Mexican American Chamber of Commerce and the Mexican Masonic Lodge. The number of social clubs, ethnic organizations and fraternal associations increased among the post-WWII growing Mexican middle class and young professionals, who announced their activities regularly in the bilingual, regional entertainment magazine | El Excentrico (FKA El Eccentríco | ).  Church groups, clubs, and organizations were also involved in charitable activities and community projects. | Social clubs, sporting events, baseball and basketball clubs, and car clubs promoted ethnic consciousness, built solidarity, and sharpened organizing and leadership skills. They offered young Mexican Americans opportunities to compete on an equal basis outside the immigrant community. Such cultural activities generated networks, created bonds of solidarity, and provided a strong foundation for the Mexican civil rights movement to emerge within a flourishing community of musicians, artists, sportsmen, and club members. | Title:  Bernie Fuentes Band, Club Cuauhtémoc Social Dance | Date: 1950s | Collection:  Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, Brooks Family Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | East Side Revelations - Lowriding | San José Public Library | After a Decades-Long Ban, San José's Lowriders Are Ready to Cruise Again - Atlas Obscura | Recreation at Parks, Churches, Beaches, Mountains and Beyond | Local parks were popular sites for large family gatherings and youth activities. During the post-WWII period, there were few parks or recreation centers in Mexican neighborhoods. Families might host small groups at home but had to travel to parks like Alum Rock to host larger groups. With the lack of neighborhood parks, the Catholic church often filled the gap by providing a place for recreational activities and community events. Catholic churches became important public spaces, with social halls used for family or community events, art programs, English classes, and neighborhood meetings. Leaders in these Catholic churches often moved on into positions of influence in labor movements and political organizations. | While the majority of ethnic Mexicans in Santa Clara County identified as Catholics, there were also Mexican Baptists, as well as Presbyterians, Methodists, and various evangelical denominations. While Mexican cultural traditions were acknowledged, many churches sponsored youth baseball and basketball teams in order to engage immigrant families in American culture and recreation. Neighborhood schools also offered organized sports. | During the post-war years, automobiles became more affordable, and families began to travel longer distances to | the beach and Boardwalk in Santa Cruz, to camp or hike in the redwoods or Mt. Hamilton, tour San Francisco, or even vacation in México. | Title: Fernando Chavez and Friends at Alum Rock Park | Date: 1950s | Collection:  Before Silicon Valley Project Archives, Fernando Chávez Family Collection | Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections | Additional Online Information | American Latino Theme Study: Sports (U.S. National Park Service)"}

Facing employment discrimination and exclusion from skilled occupations, these refugees were forced into migrant agricultural work. Mexican workers viewed labor organizing campaigns as part of the path toward equality and civil rights. During the 1930s, Santa Clara County saw some of the most significant agricultural and cannery strikes in America, many involving Mexican workers. Because of successful cannery organizing begun in the 1930s, by the 1950s many Mexicans acquired a livable wage and benefits. However, agricultural unions were stymied by the Bracero Program, which undercut strikes, as noted by labor leader Ernesto Galarza. Labor unions and social justice organizations often overlapped in their assistance to ethnic Mexican residents. | Segregation and discrimination against ethnic Mexicans occurred in both the workplace and local communities. Efforts were made, unsuccessfully, to desegregate California schools during the 1930s, until a change in strategy emerged during the post-war period. As ethnic Mexicans settled in permanent | colonias | throughout Santa Clara County after WWII, they shaped a new identity, claiming cultural space and citizenship. Mexican communities included diverse groups– immigrants, naturalized Americans, and U.S.-born Mexican Americans–so a variety of community organizations arose to serve their needs, including | mutualistas | , town, social, and recreational clubs. Community organizations and cultural activities fostered social networks, established bonds of solidarity, and provided a strong foundation for a Mexican civil rights movement to emerge within a flourishing community of musicians, artists, writers, and social activists. | The Second World War, in which Anglo Americans and ethnic Mexicans served in integrated units, brought a major change to the ethnic Mexican community as, after the war, coalitions were formed to address racial discrimination. Mexican American veterans formed the American G.I. Forum and joined the Community Service Organization (CSO), begun in Los Angeles in 1947 as a regional voice for disenfranchised communities, fighting for political reforms regarding citizenship, voting rights, economic equity, and desegregation. Both César Chávez in San José and Dolores Huerta in Stockton learned organizational and leadership lessons in their local CSO chapters. | From 1920 to 1960 Santa Clara Valley was transformed from being the nation’s largest fruit producer to becoming the center of the high-tech world. In the 1960s and 70s, large sections of the old Mexican | colonias | in Mountain View and downtown San José would be demolished through urban renewal, street development, and freeway construction, displacing families and businesses. Union contracts had provided cannery workers with a level of economic security, but as canneries closed, workers lost their middle-class incomes and benefits. While earlier civil rights advocates, like LULAC and the CSO, focused on political reform and legal challenges to discrimination, a new generation of community activists would emerge to embrace a more confrontational approach and create new alliances. The early ethnic Mexican labor and civil rights struggles in Santa Clara County between 1920 and 1960 fostered the development of the Chicano Movement of the 1960s and 70s. | EXHIBIT | MINI DOC | Title: Meeting Notice Date: 1939/01/03 | Collection: History San Jose Online Catalog Owning Institution: History San Jose Research Library | Source: Source: Calisphere"}

Within these communities, ethnic Mexicans were segregated socially, residentially, and educationally. Due to restrictive covenants (land deed restrictions) and redlining (lender refusal to offer loans in certain areas),ethnic Mexicans were forced to settle in less desirable industrial areas adjacent to the canneries and packing houses, joining the older permanent Mexican settlements of San José or forming new | colonia | settlements in outlying towns such as Mountain View and Gilroy. | Throughout Santa Clara County | colonia | residents established permanent roots and created cultural spaces that afforded a sense of belonging. Prior to World War II, immigrant associations, including town clubs and mutual aid societies—known as | sociedades | mutualistas— | accommodated newcomers by providing cultural events, networking, and information about laws, customs, and housing. A multi-faceted identity was forged by a “coalescence of cultures,” both Mexican and Mexican American. | In Santa Clara Valley, Mexicans addressed the problems of segregation and discrimination by fostering one of the most important, vibrant cultural communities in the Southwest. During the 1940s and 1950s, Mexican dance halls absorbed trans-racial musical rhythms that attracted an integrated younger generation. This music exemplifies how Santa Clara County became a significant center for the production of Mexican American cultural identity. | Despite the segregated society in which they lived and worked, Mexican immigrants, prior to becoming legal citizens, became “cultural citizens,” incorporating American values such as equal justice and participation in civic culture, creating an identity both ethnically Mexican | and | American. Cultural, social, and religious factors played a formative role in creating community, and consolidating community consciousness and political identity before and after WWII. | EXHIBIT | MINI DOC | [Brooks Band Playing San Francisco Date: circa 1950S Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, Brooks Family Collection (donated 9/30/2023) Owning Institution: SJSU Special Collections"}

Promotional literature portrayed Santa Clara County as a community of white farmers, with no mention of seasonal immigrants working in agriculture, railroads and mining. Before WWII some early immigrants, including the Japanese, Italians and Portuguese, had managed to move up from farm laborer to cannery worker or farm leaser or owner. | Not until WWII would higher paying year-round cannery jobs in Santa Clara County open up to Mexican workers. Field and orchard work was physically demanding, and many considered cannery jobs easier. However, cannery employment had its own fractious problems that divided workers by ethnicity, race, gender, English language abilities and citizenship.  The shared experiences of cannery workers at work, and at home, would strengthen both kinship and social networks. The higher paying unionized cannery jobs allowed ethnic Mexican cannery workers to move into homeownership and permanent settlement in Santa Clara County. | EXHIBIT | MINI DOC | Title: Women Cannery Workers 1945 Collection: History San Jose Photo Collection Source: Calisphere"}

Cattle production for the “hide and tallow” trade of the Mexican Era gave way to dry farming of wheat by the mid-1860s, the American period. By 1875, irrigation-reliant orchards had replaced wheat production. | During the dry-farm years of wheat production in the 1850s-1860s, Anglo American men carrying their belongings on their back (nicknamed ”bindlestiffs”) migrated throughout California in search of harvest work. With the shift to specialty orchard crops in Santa Clara Valley in the 1870s, a larger labor force was needed and included Anglo American families; Mexican | Californio | families; Chinese immigrant men; Portuguese, Spanish, Italian immigrant families; and later Japanese immigrant families. | WWI created a California farm labor shortage when European immigration became increasingly restricted and Anglo American men were recruited into the military. During WWI the market for American crops expanded to meet Europe’s needs. After the War’s end in 1919, the 1924 Immigration Act ended all Asian immigration to the U.S., further contracting the labor supply. | Immigrant families fleeing the Mexican Revolution joined the labor force in Santa Clara County’s burgeoning fruit production and processing industries. By 1915, Santa Clara County was dubbed “The Valley of Heart’s Delight,” promoting an idealized image of traditional American family farms and orchards while, in reality, the new prosperity was founded on the often-exploited labor of a largely immigrant workforce that was 80% Mexican. | During the 1920s and 1930s, establishing permanent residency in Santa Clara County proved difficult for Mexican immigrants due to the seasonal nature of their farm employment and low wages. Segregated from other employment opportunities until WWII, Mexican immigrant families traveled to farms and orchards throughout the Western States, including California and Santa Clara County. | EXHIBIT | MINI DOC | Title: Chavez Family at Kimball Ranch 1937 | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, Fernando Chavez Family Collection | Source: SJSU Special Collection (donated 9/30/2023)"}

Since early colonization in 1777, with the establishment of | El Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe | and Mission Santa Clara de Asís, and later Mission San José, Hispanics have had a presence in Santa Clara County. Their first encounters with indigenous people were members of the Ohlone tribelet, who were forced laborers on Spanish mission lands. The creation of Mexico in 1821 transformed the lives of native Californians, who joined the rancho labor force to work in the “hide and tallow” trade that lasted until 1848. | After the Mexican American War (1846-1848), Mexican political, social, and economic power declined, due to the effects of the Gold Rush (1848-1855). Anglo settlers were increasingly aggressive in seeking to acquire land from the Californios. As a result, Mexicans were forced out of political leadership | and into wage labor jobs, reduced to living on the margins of American society. | EXHIBIT | Title: The Mission of Santa Clara in 1849, from a painting by Mr. Andrew P.

Established in 1929, LULAC leadership advocated for community rights and an end to discrimination suffered by Latin American citizens in the United States. LULAC is the oldest Hispanic civil rights organization in the U.S., with a large middle-class membership and focus on the rights of citizens, and is considered more conservative in their tactical approach.  In the 1960s LULAC supported national and local candidates and mobilized Mexican American voters and candidates for political office. | Community Service Organization (CSO) | Founded in 1947 as a national organization to protect the civil rights of Mexican Americans and encourage political and civic engagement, the CSO was formed primarily by community organizers.  Although it was a national organization, individual chapters played a critical role in developing local and state policies that impacted the labor and voting rights of Mexican Americans. The local San José CSO chapter (according to La Raza Historical Society of Santa Clara Valley) worked from 1955 to 1961 “to change statewide labor laws to enable Non-citizen Old Age Pensions in California.''  After César Chávez, Gilbert Padilla, and Dolores Huerta left the CSO in 1961 to form the United Farm Workers of America (UFWA), Lino Covarrubias and other San José leaders helped workers actually receive these benefits. | During the 1960s and 1970s, three voting rights bills would prove critical to LULAC and CSO activities. The Voting Rights Acts of 1965 outlawed discriminatory voting practices adopted after the Civil War, including literacy tests as a prerequisite to voting. The Voting Rights Act Amendment of 1970 lowered the voting age in national elections to 18. This encouraged young people to engage in political activity. All of these bills would foster the creation of more politically focused advocacy groups. Finally, the Voting Rights Act of 1975 provided assistance for “language minority” citizens, offering bilingual ballots and voting instructions, and assistance for blind, disabled, or illiterate voters. | American GI Forum | The American GI Forum (AGIF) had been established after WWII by returning ethnic Mexican veterans who faced discrimination when attempting to join established groups, such the Veterans of Foreign Wars, with largely white membership. AGIF became strong advocates for Mexican American/Latino veterans with the slogan \"Education is our freedom, and freedom should be everybody's business.\"  In contrast to other Mexican American/Latino groups created prior to WWII, such as LULAC, the GI Forum took political positions in opposition to the American political establishment. The AGIF leadership campaigned against the Bracero program, supported legal challenges to school segregation, and marched in solidarity with Chicano protesters. Between 1969 and 1979, the AGIF led a national boycott against the Adolph Coors Company, challenging the corporation's discriminatory employment practices. AGIF also sponsored Mexican cultural events and commemorations such as Cinco de Mayo and 16 de Septiembre in San José, the largest such events in California. | The San José Chapter of the AGIF was established June 6, 1949, by ethnic Mexican veterans of WWII.  In the 1950s, veterans from the Korean Conflict joined the chapter.  According to the Santa Clara County La Raza Historical Society, this chapter focused on bringing in community members to serve as counselors at the Santa Clara County William James Boys Juvenile Detention Ranch. By the 1960s, the San José Chapter and the newly formed Santa Clara Chapter (1961), with the associated Ladies Auxiliaries of the AGIF, joined together to sponsor community activities such as parades, fiestas, dances, queen competitions, and fashion shows, to raise scholarship money for ethnic Mexican students.  In addition they held an annual Black and White Ball fundraiser at the Cabana Hyatt House in Palo Alto, raising millions of dollars for their cause. | 1  of | 22 | Title : “El Excentrico” Column GI Forum- Pat Vasquez | Date: 1966  April 5, | Collection: El Eccentrico | Owning Institution: California Room, San Jose Public Library | Source: Calisphere | 1966-04-05 Publisher: Bert Garcia ; El Excentrico | Additional Online Information | Chicano Movements: A Geographic History | LULAC | History | The League of United Latin-American Citizens: A Texas-Mexican Civic Organization | “The Search for a Civic Voice:  California Latino Politics” | Dr. Hector Garcia and The American GI Forum | American GI Forum of California Records | “Con Safos: A Chicano’s Journey Through Life in California” | Richard Martinez East Valley AGI Forum San Jose, CA 4/30/2022 | The Rise of Chicano Politics in the 1960s and 1970s | U.S policy | long encouraged immigrant assimilation, with new citizens expected to acquire English as their language and culture in order to become “American.”  In the United States, the term “Mexican” is a large category that encompasses American-born people of Mexican descent, immigrants from Mexico who have become naturalized citizens and Mexican nationals who reside in the United States but are not American citizens. | While some immigrants chose not to become citizens, reasoning that it might not make a difference in how they were treated, some ethnic Mexican organizations  supported naturalization. The first Mexican American organizations, during the pre-1960s period, advocated for citizenship and assimilation. During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of Mexican Americans questioned whether assimilation was possible or even desirable because of prevalent racism in the United States. | Equity in education remained a major issue, an obstacle to better jobs and a better life.  A new generation of ethnic Mexican college students uncovered their history and critically analyzed what they had been taught in public schools. At the same time, with the rise and successes of César Chávez, a sense of ethnic consciousness and unity grew around the farm labor movement. The Black Civil Rights Movement had also inspired many ethnic Mexicans to consider whether more direct strategies, moving from the courts to the streets, would be more effective in obtaining their legal rights under the U.S. Constitution. | Although ethnic Mexicans suffered the same types of economic, social, and political discrimination that African Americans and other people of color endured, there are  important differences.  American policies on immigration and citizenship affected all Mexicans. American-born Mexicans who had been deported during the Depression were suspected of taking jobs that could be offered to citizens. Ethnic Mexican families made up of  both citizens and undocumented immigrants faced the possibility of losing one or both parents to deportation.  Mexican immigrants tended to live in neighborhoods with other native language speakers in order to survive with their limited English.  Since bilingualism was not generally viewed as an asset, speaking Spanish could be an obstacle. | Some Chicanos viewed themselves as a colonized people, based on their belief that the United States government had failed to live up to the promise of full citizenship under the 1848 treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which had ended the war between the United States and Mexico. Mexican Americans were not accepted as fully American, but neither were they truly Mexican. Their closest identity was with Aztlán, the legendary original homeland in the Aztec migration stories, identified as the area of the Southwest conquered during the Mexican American War.  In this case, the terms | Chicano | and | Chicana | began to be viewed as a positive identity to express self-determination and political solidarity. | 2  of | 22 | Title : Fiestas de las Rosas Riots/Arrest | Photographer: | SPIDER SANCHEZ AND JESUS MENA GARZA | Date: Printed May 1989 | Collection: AACNA & SJSU Martin Luther King Jr Special Collections | Owning Institution: AACNA | Additional Online Information | The Chicano Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and 1970s | During the 1930s and 1940s the African American and Mexican American Civil Rights Movements had worked closely together on legal strategies. Several decades later the African American Civil Rights Movements fight for equality in the South during the 1950s and 1960s inspired the Chicano Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and 1970s. While The Chicano Civil Rights Movement worked on many societal injustices, it focused on key issues of | land ownership, rural and urban workers' rights, artistic expression, and educational and political equality | . The Chicano Movement sought to | combat institutional racism, promote cultural autonomy, and work to guarantee equal labor and political rights | . This movement would spark a national conversation about the political and social autonomy of Mexican American/Latino groups everywhere in the United States. | The term | Hispanic | was popularized in the 1970s as a bureaucratic convenience to categorize all Spanish-speaking people in the United States. This term ignores the fact that there are many different cultural groups within the “Hispanic” label, each with their own history and experiences. Though the impact of the Chicano Movement was felt across the country, each region could have a different focus because of historical and cultural variations.  In the Southwest, particularly in Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, the majority of Spanish-speaking communities identified with a Spanish colonial past, rather than a Mexican immigrant history. | California, even with its origins as a Spanish and Mexican territory, was relatively isolated from the center of Mexican culture and government due to its geographically inaccessible deserts and mountains. During the California Gold Rush, the small population of Spanish New World colonists and their descendants were overwhelmed by immigrants from every nation, along with the Americans who soon dominated the state’s power structure and economy.  It was not until after the Mexican Revolution, World War II’s Bracero Program, and the post-War period that California saw large numbers of newly documented and undocumented immigrants residing in the state. | As a result, the Chicano Movement in California, established by the children and grandchildren of these pre-1960s Mexican immigrants, forged a new identity and increased their political influence by the use of the new, more confrontational tactics of the 1960s and 1970s. In the Santa Clara Valley, the original group of Spanish-speaking settlers has been continually renewed and enlarged over the last 150 years by immigrants from Mexico and Latin America and migrants from throughout the Southwest.  The largest group of Spanish-speaking immigrants has historically come from Mexico. | 3  of | 22 | Title : Chicano Educational Pilgrimage | Photographer: Unknown | Date: Printed April 1989 | Collection: AACNA | Owning Institution: AACNA | Additional Online Information | Midcentury Migrations - FoundSF | How the Chicano Movement Championed Mexican-American Identity and Fought for Change | HISTORY | “Mexican Immigrants in the San Francisco Bay Area:  A Summary of Current Knowledge, 1982” file:///Users/scarlet-tanager/Downloads/ucsd024.pdf | From Servants To Engineers: Mexican Immigration And Labor Markets In The San Francisco Bay Area | Background on the Chicano Movement | Facing History & Ourselves | Making History: The Chicano Movement | El Movimiento: The Chicano Movement and Hispanic Identity in the United States – Pieces of History | The Chicano Rights Movement | Season 2018 | Episode 1 | PBS | The Chicano Movement: A Short Overview · South Texas Stories · Bell Library Exhibits | Chicano Oral History Projec | t | (SJSU Special Collections) | WOMEN IN THE CHICANO MOVEMENT: Grassroots Activism in San José | Chicano Movements: A Geographic History | The Ideology and Goals of The Chicano Civil Rights Movement, 1968-1969 | Chicano cultural nationalism was clearly expressed in the 1968 | El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán | , written by the | Denver, Colorado based Crusade for Justice, an ethnic Mexican civil rights and educational organization founded by Corky Gonzalez. Gonzalez was the author of the 1967 poem | I am Joaquin | , which expressed a critique of racism that requires assimilation and the denial of one’s roots.  It | states: | …that social, economic, cultural, and political independence is the only road to total liberation from oppression, exploitation, and racism. Our struggle then must be for the control of our barrios, campos, pueblos, lands, our economy, our culture, and our political life | The Plan promoted cultural nationalism, pride in Mexican culture, and the creation of independent Chicano political and economic institutions, with community control of schools, advocating for self-defense, and supporting militant protest. | The following year | , El Plan de Santa Barbara, A Chicano Plan for Higher Education | was written by the Chicano Coordinating Council on Higher Education, a group of students at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The 155-page document was created as a blueprint for the development of Chicana/o Studies programs in colleges and universities in the United States.  It would also become the foundation for the Chicano student group | Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán | ( | MEChA | ). | In 1969, students from twelve universities met at a conference in Santa Barbara, calling for the unification of all student and youth organizations into one organization to be called the | Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán | (MEChA).  This included the United Mexican American Students (UMAS), the Mexican American Student Conference (MASC), and the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO). These groups represented student chapters from middle schools through the university level. | Both | El Plan Espiritual | de Aztlán | and | El Plan de Santa Barbara | were later criticized for excluding women and the LGBT community, reflecting the biases of that time. For this reason, the goals of the Plan for achieving inclusivity are viewed as a work in progress, continually modified by generations of Chicanx scholars. | 4  of | 22 | Title : Protest Against Vietnam War - College students and other people marching | \"VENCEREMOS!

The violence demonstrated by police at the march increased distrust and hostility of the community toward law enforcement and increased support for The Chicano Movement. | 5  of | 22 | Title : Protest Against Vietnam War / LA Moratorium ( | Two women at the LA Moratorium raising their right fists in solidarity) | Photographer: Unknown | Date: August 29, 1970 | Collection: AACNA Special Collections | Owning Institution: SJSU | Additional Online Information | 1970: National Chicano Moratorium - A Latinx Resource Guide: Civil Rights Cases and Events in the United States | Thousands of Mexican American antiwar activists march in Chicano Moratorium | August 29, 1970 | HISTORY | Chicano Moratorium: A Question of Freedom (1971) | UCLA Film & Television Archive helps keep full picture of L.A.’s Chicano history alive | Protests, Yesterday And Today | “50 Years Later:  The Political and Social Impacts of the 1970 Chicano Moratorium” | https://www.kpcc.org/programs/airtalk/2020/08/24/65941/50-years-later-the-political-and-social-impacts-of/ | National Chicano Advocacy Groups:  MALDEF, SCLR and SVREP | Mexican American Legal Defence and Education Fund (MALDEF) | The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) was established in 1968 to battle voter suppression tactics, using the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund as a model. In 1970, MALDEF successfully challenged a Texas legislative initiative that had created “mega districts,” which the U.S. Supreme Court later ruled unconstitutional for inhibiting minority voter participation. This ruling led to the Voting Rights Act of 1975. | Southwest Council of La Raza (SCLR) | The Southwest Council of La Raza (SCLR)  was founded in 1968 in Phoenix, Arizona, by Herman Gallegos, Dr. Julian Samora, and Dr. Ernesto Galarza with the goal of reducing poverty and discrimination, and to improve life opportunities for Latino Americans. Their initial efforts were focused on the Southwestern states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado. In 1972 they opened a national headquarters in Washington, D.C. with a new name, the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), which reflected their expansion into communities across the United States. These actions supported advocacy, developed resources, and helped strengthen Hispanic community-based organizations. | Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP) | One of the most successful advocacy groups was founded in 1974 by William C. Velásquez. The goal of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP) was to mobilize and empower the Latino community by facilitating voter registration drives and initiating legal challenges. By 1988 a total of 75 lawsuits had been filed to help undo gerrymandering and eliminate language barriers and other voter suppression practices. | 6  of | 22 | Title : MALDEF The Fight for Mexican -American Rights | Photographer: Aubrey Haines | Date: July 05,1978 | Collection: El Eccentrico | Owning Institution: Garcia, Bert | Source: SJ Public Library | Additional Online Information | History | MALDEF | Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund | Civil Rights, Education & Advocacy | Britannica | National Council of La Raza Records | Southwest Council of La Raza (SWCLR), 1968 | New Mexico Archives Online | 1974: Southwest Voter Registration Education Project - A Latinx Resource Guide: Civil Rights Cases and Events in the United States | Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP) | Library of Congress | National Chicano Advocacy Groups: The Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) and the La Raza Unida Party (LRUP), 1970s | La Raza Unida Party (LRUP) created the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) in Crystal City, Texas, as part of Plan de Aztlán. MAYO had been started by five students at St. Mary's University in Austin, Texas in 1967 (see Section 6.12 on Advocacy in K-12 schools for the MAYO chapter in Santa Clara County). Inspired by the Black Civil Rights Movement and by leaders Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X, LRUP was a Mexican American third party movement that supported candidates for elective office in Texas, California, and eventually in other areas of the Southwest and Midwest. | Ernesto Galarza, then teaching in Santa Clara County, was elected Chairman of the La Raza Unida Party Conference at an organizational meeting in 1967. La Raza Unida began as a loose confederation of Latino/Mexican American civic, social, and cultural groups whose representatives were in El Paso to attend hearings of the U.S. Cabinet Committee on Mexican American Affairs. By their second conference in San Antonio in January 1968, chapters were being organized throughout the United States. While LRUP achieved some local success in elective offices in Texas, its greatest accomplishment was to inspire greater participation in the electoral process and advocate for the interests of the Latino community. | 7  of | 22 | Title : Chicano Student Rally | Photographer: Spartan Daily News | Date: 1968 -10-11 | Collection: Spartan Daily Negatives Collection | Owning Institution: San Jose State University Library Special Collections & Archive | Source: SJSU King Library Digital Collections | Additional Online Information | A BRIEF HISTORY OF LA RAZA UNIDA PARTY | The historical legacy of the Raza Unida Party | The California-Mexico Studies Center, Inc. | Raza Unida Party Chapters 1970-1974 - Mapping American Social Movements | UNITED WE WIN: The Rise and Fall of La Raza Unida.

The establishment of CRU was a direct result of a violent confrontation between police and protestors at the | Fiesta de Las Rosas | (FDLR) celebration in San José on June 1, 1969. | The FDLR was a floral parade during the late 1920s that celebrated the city and | county’s mythical Spanish heritage with floats and people in costume. The event had not been held since 1933 due to the Great Depression, and the idea was revived in 1966 as an event that would help revitalize a declining downtown San José. While some members of the ethnic Mexican community supported the event, others asked them to boycott the event, explaining that it ignored the fact that many ethnic Mexican neighborhoods still lacked adequate housing or public services. An estimated 75,000 people attended the event, including 100 protestors, representing some 35 San Francisco Bay Area Chicano organizations.  Police charged the protestors as they assembled to join the parade, claiming that the protestors attacked, forcing the police to use riot tactics. As portrayed in the media, the confrontation reinforced stereotypes of ethnic Mexicans as criminals and trouble makers. | After their encounter with the police, the protestors gathered at Guadalupe Church on the Eastside to discuss the event and decided that a coalition group was needed to deal with the interrelated issues they faced. Within a year the CRU had opened an office in downtown San José, representing a majority of organizations in Santa Clara County working with the Spanish-speaking community. By 1971 the CRU represented over 200,000 ethnic Mexicans in Santa Clara County, with members from various political, civic, religious, and educational backgrounds. | 8  of | 22 | Title: Rodolfo “ Corky” Gonzales | Photographer: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Date: 1970-1975 | Collection: JMMGarza Photos | Owning Institution: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Source: | https://jmmgarza.com/chicano-photographer | Additional Online Information | Confederacion de la Raza Unida v.

She was one of the pioneers who built the Chicano Movement for civil rights and equal justice here. Attached is an article we received from her daughter, Doreen Garcia Nevel. A reprint from the East Side Sun, it appeared in El Excentrico Magazine | “Hearings Before the Subcommittee To Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws” Part 22, 1971, Statement of Jack Ibarra, President of Confederation de La Raza Unida, San Jose, California: | Local Chapters of National Advocacy Groups: United Farm Workers (UFW) | Farm workers had been specifically excluded from the protection of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 because Southern Congressmen did not want to enable labor organizing among Southern Black agricultural and domestic workers.  American farm workers were not guaranteed the right to organize and had no guaranteed minimum wage.  Without federal protection, state laws that applied to farm workers were largely ignored. | In Santa Clara County, as in many parts of California, the majority of agricultural laborers were people of color living at the poverty level, often Spanish speaking with limited English skills, whose children might also be employed.  Agricultural work was seasonal, so migrant laborers followed the harvests from one region to another, making them a difficult group to organize. | Another major obstacle was the Bracero Program, Public Law 78, started during WWII as a temporary agreement between the United States and Mexico to recruit  workers to relieve a labor shortage.  The program continued until 1973 with the encouragement of local growers. Legally, no bracero could replace a domestic worker, though this provision was rarely enforced. Bracero workers could be used as strikebreakers and could be paid less, which depressed farm workers’ wages in general. | In the decades immediately prior to the creation of the United Farm Workers Association (UFWA), two organizations had tried to organize farm workers in California. The Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee had been formed in 1959 by the AFL-CIO based on the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), which Dolores Huerta helped to found | in 1960 while continuing to work with the CSO in Stockton. | AWOC was largely composed of Filipinos, Chicanos, Anglos. and Black workers, and led by experienced Filipino field organizer Larry Itliong. | The National Farm Workers of America (NFWA) had been started by former Community Service Organization (CSO) organizers César Chávez, Dolores Huerta, and Gilbert Padilla in 1962. Beginning as an organizer in San José in 1952, Chávez, who had grown up as a farm worker, had risen through the ranks to become national director of the CSO. Although the CSO worked with local communities to identify and resolve urban problems, it was not interested in organizing farm workers, so Chávez, Huerta, and Padilla left in 1962 to found the NFWA. | At the end of the summer in 1965, farm workers with the AWOC demanded $1.25 per hour to pick the grape crop. When growers refused, on September 8, workers at nine farms went on strike.  Growers then brought in strikebreakers, and the AWOC asked the NFWA to join the strike. On September 16, the NFWA voted unanimously to strike, and asked the public not to | buy grapes without a union label.  NFWA and AWOC merged to become the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee, AFL-CIO (UFWOC) and the grape boycott became one of their first joint efforts. | Born in Delano, Luís Váldez had returned to help the farm worker movement in 1965 after graduating from SJSU.  That year, he created El Teatro Campesino (The Farmworkers Theater). | The following year, Váldez, Dolores Huerta, and César Chávez drafted the | El Plan de Delano | , which framed the farm labor movement as a nonviolent revolution for social justice.  UFWOC, as Chávez had envisioned, had become both a union and a civil rights movement. | I | n 1975, renamed the United Farm Workers (UFW), they won the passage of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, a landmark agreement recognizing the right of farm workers in California to organize. | In the face of continued opposition from the government and agribusiness, farm workers and Chicano student activists organized one of the largest labor rights campaigns in U.S. Farm Labor history, which was a significant milestone for the Chicano Movement. | The Civil Rights Movement had, in more than two centuries of struggle, increased public awareness of the effects of racism against people of color, such as lower standards of living and discrimination in housing, employment, schools, voting, and everyday life. While the Civil Rights Movement had focused on the treatment of Blacks in America, the struggle for farm labor rights in California showed that this was also a struggle for civil rights. Because of César Chávez’s connection to Santa Clara County during the 1950s through his residency and his work with the Community Service Organization, Chávez maintained close ties during his UFW years. He often worked with Guadalupe Church, the CSO, and his sister Rita Chávez Medina during his UFW campaigns. | 9  of | 22 | Title : Marcher With La Virgen | Photographer: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Date: 1970-1975 | Collection: JMM Garza Photos | Owning Institution: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Source: | https://jmmgarza.com/chicano-photographer | Scholar Talk | Image | Additional Online Information | UFW History | 1962: United Farm Workers Union - A Latinx Resource Guide: Civil Rights Cases and Events in the United States | The Farm Worker Movement | PBS LearningMedia | Cesar Chavez: American Civil Rights Activist - Fast Facts | History | American History Tellers | United Farm Workers: Birth of a Movement | Podcast | American History Tellers | United Farm Workers: The Fall | Podcast | Decline of the Canneries and Impact on Local Ethnic Mexican Population Led to Local Chicano Advocacy | With the rise of Silicon Valley in the 1960s, Valley canneries were in decline due to the postwar transition from an agricultural to a technological/industrial economy.  Technology was a booming field which attracted both local residents and new immigrants to the Valley, also contributing to a housing shortage.  Agricultural employment declined as farmers sold entire orchards for real estate and industrial development. Consequently, many local canneries closed during this period.  Though Mexican workers found local employment in urban construction and suburban domestic work, they were not as successful on the assembly lines of Silicon Valley’s emerging tech industry. | In 1967, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act required that jobs not be gendered into “male” or “female” work. Title VII afforded more opportunities for women to work in warehousing and shipping, occupations traditionally reserved for men.  Although cannery women’s benefits were lower than men’s,, in the 1970s and 1980s cannery work offered women stability, enabling many women to become homeowners and create worker neighborhoods, according to sociologist Patricia Zavella. Historian Glenna Matthews notes that this changed when the Teamsters took cannery representation away from the American Federation of Labor (AFL).  In the 1970s and 1980s César Chávez’s new organization, the United Farm Workers of America (UFWA), created a legal project called “The Cannery Workers Committee” (CWC) to protest Teamster discriminatory treatment.  Using the Civil Rights Act Title VII, the CWC won a number of cases that enabled ethnic Mexican cannery women to move from seasonal line work to higher paying, permanent warehouse-related cannery jobs. | By 1976, most cannery jobs were unionized, providing ethnic Mexican women with wage, medical, holiday and retirement benefits.  Technology workers were not as fortunate, holding jobs that were not unionized, providing none of the benefits. By 1987, there were only eight canneries left in the Santa Clara County, and by 1999 Del Monte had closed Plant #3, the world’s largest cannery operation. The demise of the canneries took access to well-paid union jobs with their opportunities for advancement away from ethnic Mexican workers. | 10  of | 22 | Jesús Manuel Mena Garza, Del Monte Pickles , Garza Personal Collection, From 1970-1975 Series.

The largest concentration of ethnic Mexicans in Santa Clara County resided in the unincorporated area of San Jose’s developing Eastside. Downtown San José, adjacent to the historic downtown Mexican | colonia | , became the hub of a vibrant regional business and entertainment district that drew Spanish-speaking clients residing in the Eastside | colonia, | worker neighborhoods in surrounding towns, and smaller unincorporated communities of Santa Clara County. | Between 1960 and 1970 the population of Santa Clara County grew by 66%, with Spanish-surnamed residents growing from 12% to 18%. As the most-populated municipality in the County, housing the largest number of ethnic Mexicans, San José continued to serve as the center for social, cultural, and political activity for ethnic Mexicans in the South Bay.  Unlike other urban areas, where “white flight” resulted in a declining urban core, the ethnic Mexican population settled in these areas, starting businesses and raising families. Annexation of the Eastside into the City of San José did not immediately bring needed improvements in streets, water or sewage systems. This was because San José had long relied on municipal bonds for civic improvements rather than raising taxes, which gave the growing city only sporadic access to funds. | San José had grown exponentially, from 17 square miles in 1920 to 120 in 1970, sprawling toward nearby towns such as Cupertino and Sunnyvale. Annexation of adjacent communities soon converted orchards, farms, and canning and packing operations to technology/industrial parks and housing tracts. These growing communities now prioritized access to public services and infrastructure improvements. | The 1958 the “Master Plan of the City of San José” fell in line with the goals of President Lyndon Baines Johnson’s anti-poverty programs of the 1960s. The federal Model Cities Program identified the central business district as crucial to the City’s growth and economy and one of its chief objectives for the City’s central core included an urban renewal program. The aim of the Model Cities Plan for urban renewal was to prevent existing blight from spreading, rehabilitate areas that could be restored, and to clear and rebuild those that were not “worth” saving (worth being a subjective term).  The Redevelopment Agency’s first major urban renewal project in San José during 1967 was Park Center Plaza.  Thirteen blocks encompassing nearly all of the west-of-Market neighborhood next to the center of downtown would eventually displace 466 mostly ethnic Mexican residents and 136 businesses. In 1968, San José applied for additional monies through the Model Cities Program. | In 1970 four assembly districts that received federal Model Cities Program funding were in the predominantly ethnic Mexican neighborhoods of Mayfair, Tropicana, Olinder, and Gardner. Existing worker housing near fruit processing plants and canneries downtown and in the Eastside were identified to be cleared as part of the Plan. | These ethnic Mexican neighborhoods also stood in the way of freeway expansion for Highways 280 and 680. The resulting demolition of blocks of existing residences and small businesses caused the displacement of local residents and the further fragmentation of older ethnic Mexican neighborhoods.  Local residents questioned the definition of “blighted” and whether one of the criteria were the higher numbers of people who spoke little or no English. Homes and businesses in this area were often sold for less than fair market value, so options for purchasing other property were extremely limited. | In response, the younger generation of Chicano organizers expected more action from their local government now that ethnic Mexicans also served on municipal councils and commissions. They were skeptical of large federal programs such as the Model Cities Programs and lobbied and mobilized in the streets to address issues such as discrimination in housing, institutional racism, police brutality, healthcare access, and labor rights. New organizations like the Brown Berets, United People Arriba (UPA), and the Community Alert Patrol (CAP) reflected efforts by these younger Chicano groups to focus directly on these issues on a local level. | Despite legal challenges to the Model Cities Program, redevelopment plans were generally supported by city residents who believed that they were necessary in order to create a stable local economy and safer neighborhoods. | 11  of | 22 | Jesús Manuel Mena Garza, SJ Redevelopment, Garza Personal Collection, From 1970-1975 Series.

Before WWII, most ethnic Mexicans attended public school only up to the 8th grade. After WWII, ethnic Mexican students attended public high school, and some even enrolled in college. Public education for immigrant groups typically emphasized Americanization, prioritizing English skills and useful trades. Although segregated schools were no longer legal in California after the 1947 | Mendez v. Westminster | case, schools in Mexican neighborhoods were often older facilities with fewer resources, and few had Spanish-speaking teachers. Ethnic Mexican high school students were not tracked to college.  Frances Palacios, | who attended San José public schools | , | described a meeting with her high school counselor: “I told him what I wanted to take. When I did, he told me I didn't have the brains for it and would probably fall through, and to continue taking typing and filing. So, I did. I didn't take any college prep courses, because he felt I was incapable” (Frances Palacios, Chicano Oral History College, Special Collections, SJSU Library). Palacios eventually earned a BA and an MA in order to become a high school counselor who would help ethnic Mexican students go to college. | Local ethnic Mexican parents became increasingly concerned about the poor quality of education that their children received. At Roosevelt Junior High School in San José, parents found that the police assigned to the school harassed ethnic Mexican students, and these children received discriminatory treatment from both teachers and other students. The parents pressured the school district and succeeded in replacing 36 teachers, a principal, and a vice principal.  Despite the new faculty, the parents were still fighting structural inequality in the school system.  Similar to other ethnic Mexican high school students throughout the U.S. in the 1960s, and in particular in 1967 Los Angeles (the first such action in California), students at Roosevelt Junior High School organized a “Blow Out” (or walkout) to resolve the educational inequalities. | The Chicano Movement established an empowering political and cultural identity that was both Mexican and American.  Chicano students of all ages in Santa Clara County might be involved concurrently in local community organizations like United People | Arriba | (UPA – United People Upward) and the Brown Berets (BB), and in student-led groups like the Student Initiative (SI), the Mexican American Student Confederation (MASC), Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO), and the United Mexican American Students (UMAS). Meeting with other Chicano student groups and other students of color, they found common ground with young activists throughout California and across the nation. | A chapter of | MAYO was | started at San José High School with the help of organizer Lino Lopez in 1968. At that time Lopez worked with Mexican American youth and local schools in Santa Clara County to create bilingual programs. | MAYO, founded in 1967 in San Antonio, Texas, stressed Chicano cultural nationalism and direct political confrontation, using mass demonstrations involving both university students and teenagers to accomplish its goals. | 12  of | 22 | Title : Sofi Mendoza; United People Arriba | Photographer: Unknown | Date: Unknown | Collection: AACNA SJSU Martin Luther King Jr. Library Special Collection | Owning Institution: AACNA Center | Source: East Side Dreams | Additional Online Information | Mexican-American School Walkout Focused on Problem June 26, 1970 | VOCES | MAYO | Season 2016 | Episode 1 | PBS | 5th Annual Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) Conference (San Francisco, CA) | California Revealed | (1962) Mexican-American Youth Organization (MAYO) Speech #chicana #chicano #mexicanamerican #latina | The Chicano Rights Movement | Season 2018 | Episode 1 | PBS | Jack Brito Part 4/8: San José Schools & Roosevelt Jr. High Protests 8/15/2014 | San José's Proud Legacy of Struggle for Chicano Rights : Indybay | San José Local Groups Fight Discrimination in College Education | After WWII and during the 1950s, ethnic Mexican civil rights organizations focused on providing scholarships, reducing high school dropout rates, and promoting college recruitment to help Mexican Americans professionalize, with the aim that educated workers would then give back to their communities.  Returning veterans attended college on the GI Bill, and some applied their degrees to education and social services. During the 1960s and 1970s, Mexican American students pursued a new direction, calling themselves “Chicanos” and creating new ethnic Mexican civil rights organizations emphasizing cultural nationalism. | Most ethnic Mexicans chose to attend the more affordable community colleges before transferring into four year colleges or universities.  San José City College (SJCC) served as such a launching ground. In 1965, Los Amigos, a student organization at San José City College, was founded primarily by young returning veterans to improve educational programs and to keep students in school, working with middle and high school students. Los Amigos programs also dealt with at-risk youth in Juvenile Hall. In 1966, the GI Bill was expanded to include Vietnam War veterans, and many of these older students attended community colleges. At San José City College, students organized tutoring programs and cultural activities and advocated for better educational opportunities.  When these students moved on to four-year colleges and universities, they continued their activism. | In the 1950s, San José State University (SJSU) was considered a conservative university in its views on race and class. This changed rapidly when ethnic Mexican students of color transferred from the more affordable San José City College to SJSU in the 1960s. The transfer students brought a host of student-led initiatives and activism with them, enabling and leading student demonstrations, walkouts, and picketing.  These activities led to the establishment of a counseling center and services for Chicano students prior to the creation of the Equal Opportunity Program (EOP) at SJSU. | In 1966, SJSU student Armando Valdez | o | rganized Student Initiative (SI), the first Chicano student organization at San José State. SI was dedicated to developing Mexican American student leadership and working with the campus Equal Opportunity Program (EOP). SI began working with local community groups and recruiting high school students to attend recruitment and orientation events at SJSU. Networking with other Chicano student groups statewide, SI transformed into the Mexican American Student Confederation (MASC), advocating for changes in the SJSU curriculum and textbooks, and for the creation of a Mexican American studies program at SJSU.  Bilingual education was also a major focus, with Ernesto Galarza serving as a non-faculty advocate.  In 1968 SI organized the Chicano Commencement walkout, protesting the low  Chicano student enrollment and low numbers of Chicano faculty. This walkout was the first protest by Mexican American students on a college campus in California. | In 1968, equity in education was still a major priority for the ethnic Mexican community, and many different student organizations had been started in high schools and colleges to support these students. Often, parents and teachers were deeply involved in these groups. The Mexican American Student Confederation (MASC) at SJSU created summer cultural programs to teach junior high school students Mexican visual art, music, dances, and cooking. They created the Mexican American Culture Center, which was established in 1999 at Mexican Heritage Plaza. MASC transformed into the Students for the Advancement of Mexican Americans (SAMA). | This same year, a student strike at San Francisco State College was organized by the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF), demanding the creation of a Department of Raza Studies under the School of Ethnic Studies as well as open admission to all students of color. This event, which had led to violent confrontations between students and police, prompted Mexican Americans and other third world student activists to form a rainbow coalition in which many San José State University (SJSU) and Santa Clara University Chicano students participated. | These protests led to the establishment of the Chicano Studies Program at SJSU, the oldest Graduate Program in Chicana/o Studies in the country, and catalyzed a push for a separate Chicano Commencement.  Among the groups pressing for change at SJSU were the Chicano Vietnam War veterans who were activated by the anti-Vietnam War Movement and returning to school on the GI Bill. Students like Victor Garza, now Dean at Evergreen Valley College, and Ramon Martinez, retired teacher, principal, and administrator in San José Unified School District, reached out to local high schools to encourage students to attend college, and to come to SJSU. | In the 1960s, Chicano student activists organized on college campuses throughout Santa Clara County, California, and across the nation. SJSU students Luís Váldez, a scholarship recipient in math and physics, and Roberto Rubalcava j oined the Marxist Progressive Labor Party (PLP) and traveled to Cuba in 1964 as part of a PLP delegation.  While many of their contemporaries embraced the more conservative political approach of accommodation and assimilation in American society held by the previous generation, Váldez and Rubalcava took a more radicalized approach to politics. | Together they produced the first Mexican American radical manifesto, “Venceremos!: Mexican American Statement on Travel to Cuba,” diverging from older Mexican American middle class civil rights organizations’ assimilationist policies. Váldez changed his major to Theater and joined the anti-establishment radical theater group the San Francisco Mime Troupe upon graduation, where he would continue his critique of assimilation tactics. | In 1965, Váldez participated in César Chávez’s farm worker organizing efforts in Delano, and wrote the Plan de Delano, which promoted the principle of organizing for social justice. That same year, Váldez founded the Teatro Campesino, recruiting its members from among Chicano student activists in northern California. | Dr. Carlos Muñoz, founding chair of the first Chicano Studies Department in the nation in 1968 at the California State University at Los Angeles and founding chair of the National Association of Chicana & Chicano Studies (NACCS), credits Luís Váldez and the cultural work of the Teatro Campesino for many of the concepts of Chicano identity and the emergence of the Generación Chicana. | 13  of | 22 | Title : | Photographer: | Date: | Collection: El Eccentrico | Owning Institution: | Source: | Additional Online Information | 50th Chicano Reunion San Jose State: Original '68 Walkout Students, In Memorium Part 3/3 11/4/2023 | SJSU to Host Revisiting the 1968 Chicano Commencement Symposium Oct. 11 | SJSU forum focuses on 50th anniversary of Chicano activists' walkout | 1960s-Era Chicano Student Activists Celebrate Historic SJSU Graduation Protest - CBS San Francisco | San Jose recalls Chicano protest | SJSU News | San José State University Chicano Oral History Collection | SJSU Chicano Student History 1970s:  Ramon J.

In 1963 the Community Improvement Center (CIC) began as a self-help program. Sofia Mendoza started working with the CIC in 1963 and was a founding member of  Community Alert Patrol (CAP). She remembered, “We just had it. We had reached our limit. The police had guns, mace and billy clubs. They were always ready to attack us. It seemed as if nobody could stop what the police were doing” ( | Roots of Social Justice Organizing in Silicon Valley). | CAP was created to deal with complaints of police harassment and brutality, similar to the Black Panthers in Oakland. Close to a thousand local residents were trained to observe and record police interactions with the public, the most active participants being San José State University students involved in organizing for ethnic studies classes. | Community Progress League (CPL) | The CIC evolved into the Community Progress League (CPL) by 1965, with Sofia Mendoza leading the campaign to work with parents at Theodore Roosevelt Junior High in the ethnic Mexican Mayfair neighborhood.  As discussed in section 6.4, several ethnic Mexican children told their parents that other students and even some teachers had used racial epithets against them. These children had been reluctant to talk and Mendoza encouraged other parents to become involved. Eventually several teachers and the principal were replaced.  Despite the new staff, ethnic Mexican parents and some teachers felt other changes were needed in the curriculum and support system for their children.  They organized a student blowout/walkout in 1967 at Roosevelt Junior High, which was an inspiration for the LA “Blowouts” (walkouts) and the Chicano Moratorium March the following year. | United People | Arriba | (UPA – United People Upward) | The success of the walkout encouraged the group to create United People Arriba ( | Upward | ) (UPA) in 1967, which broadened the scope of membership and concerns to include multiple groups and issues. Mendoza and co-organizer Fred Hirsch lead the group.  Mendoza recalled, | “We wanted an organization that was not limited to one ethnic group, that would organize our entire community, so we called ourselves United People Arriba—United People Upward. We liked the term ‘United People’ because it got the idea across that people from different ethnic backgrounds were coming together in San Jose to work for social change—Blacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and whites working together in one organization” | ( | Roots of Social Justice Organizing in Silicon Valley). | One hundred thirty people attended their first meeting, many of whom had been involved with the school walkout. They developed a committee system to deal with multiple issues: improving local health services, challenging discriminatory education, expanding welfare rights, monitoring policing tactics, and increasing employment and better housing. | 14  of | 22 | Title : Sofia | Photographer: Unknwon | Date: 1950s | Collection: San José Public Library California Room | Owning Institution: San Jose Public Library | Source: Revelations Spotlighting East San José by Shane Curtin and Estella Inda | Additional Online Information | Roots of Social Justice Organizing in Silicon Valley | Reimagine! | The Chicana Civil Rights Activist Who Helped Transform San José Housing - KQED Pop | East Side Revelations - Sofia Mendoza | San José Public Library | East San José Celebrates the Life of Sofia Mendoza | SOFIA MENDOZA | Sofia Mendoza Women Leaders of San José, CA The 1960's & 1970's Part 1/3  4/24/2010 | In Memory of Fred Hirsch | Local 393 | Fred Hirsch: Doing the Work That Needed To Be Done | Convergence | Guide to the Fred Hirsch Ephemera Collection | Fred Hirsch | Expanding Community Advocacy in Santa Clara County With CIC, CAP, CPL And UPA | The Mexican American Community Services Agency, Inc. (MACSA) was organized in 1964 by Santa Clara County ethnic Mexican activists to identify ways to respond to the discrimination, racism, poverty, police brutality, educational inequity, and inadequate access to public services that existed in Silicon Valley.  Their methods emphasized self-help, coalition building, and neighborhood organizing based on the model established by the Community Services Organization (CSO) of the 1950s. Young people were of particular concern to MACSA because many students were afraid to complain to their parents about the harassment and discriminatory treatment they experienced in schools. Compounding the problem were prevailing attitudes held by many ethnic Mexican parents who saw teachers as authority figures who were not to be questioned. MACSA, however, was broadly successful in focusing its efforts on youth, families, and senior outreach with targeted educational cultural activities and programs. In addition, MACSA developed nutrition programs as well as employment and training programs at youth centers, schools, libraries, and community sites. | 15  of | 22 | Title : La Voz Estudiantil, Volume 1, No.3 (Getting People Together) | Photographer: Unknown | Date: 1983 | Collection: San Jose State Scholarworks AACNA Digital Collections | Owning Institution: SJSU Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library | Source: San Jose State University , Mexican American Graduate Studies | Additional Online Information | Local Community Advocacy: Brown Berets and Black Berets in San José | In 1967, David Sanchez dissolved Young Citizens for Community Action to form the Brown Berets (BB), a self-defense group based in East Los Angeles. The BB was known as a militant youth group that protested educational neglect and police brutality, and had strong links to the community and to East LA high school. Together, BB members and students began a series of pickets in front of sheriffs’ offices and police stations. | San José’s Brown Berets were organized in the same year and based on the East LA group and Oakland’s Black Panther Party.  The Panthers were a Marxist–Leninist and black power political group founded by college students Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton in October 1966. San José’s Brown Berets described their mission as protecting the Chicano community from police brutality, promoting equal employment, housing, education, and voting rights, as well as protecting the right to bear arms, and as advocates for bilingual education.  They often provided security for protest marches and community events, buffering these groups from potential police harassment. | Other organizations took up a black beret and called themselves the Black Berets, in honor of Che Guevara. Their perspective was anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist, and internationalist. They created and assisted in many community programs such as food distribution, community patrols, and other activities. While most active in other areas of the Southwest, the Black Berets in San José also made alliances with other groups, and provided security for the Roosevelt Junior High School walkout in 1967. | 16  of | 22 | Title : Boycott Gallo (Brown Berets Present in the March) | Photographer: Unknown | Date: Possibly 1970’s | Collection: AACNA Digital Collections | Owning Institution: San Jose State University Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library | Source: AACNA  Digital Collections | Additional Online Information | \"To Protect and To Serve: Effects of the Relationship Between the Brown\" by Paul Flores | Brown Berets Hail 'La Raza' and Scorn the Establishment June 16, 1969 | FACEism: Footage shows clash between police, East LA protesters who changed the Chicano movement | Carlos Montes oral history interview conducted by David P.

The mix of cultural influences that were considered inferior to White Americans was a central concept for the Chicano Movement. These beliefs reflected the forging of a unique identity, one that crossed borders and cultures. | The 1960s were marked by cultural nationalist struggles in the Third World and an international student movement. The US also reflected this generational change with the emergence of multiple social and political movements, including domestic Black Power, hippie counterculture, and massive mobilization against the war in Vietnam. The national flowering of the Chicano Arts Movement in the US found expression in a  variety of mediums, including Theater, Painting/Murals, Music, and Literature. Artists composed slogans of solidarity and envisioned art and culture as crucial aspects of social transformation. Chicano arts would reinforce a positive identity and fortify the community. The Chicano Civil Rights Movement reaffirmed a centuries-long struggle for human and cultural rights | 17  of | 22 | Title : Centro Cultural De La Gente | Photographer: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Date: 1970-1975 | Collection: JMM Garza Photo | Owning Institution: JMMGARZA.com | Additional Online Information | “The History of Mexican Americans in California” (include Chicano Cultural Movement) | Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California (Mexican Americans) | The California Chicano Cultural Movement:  Chicano Theater Movement | El Teatro Campesino | El Teatro Campesino | (The Farmworkers’ Theater), one of the most influential elements of the Chicano Arts Movement, has its roots in San José.  San José State College students Luís Váldez and Roberto Rubalcava joined the Marxist Progressive Labor Party (PLP) and traveled to Cuba in 1964 as part of a PLP delegation. Váldez joined the anti-establishment radical theater group the San Francisco Mime Troupe upon graduation. He was introduced to guerilla theater and Italian Commedia dell'arte, forms which would influence the development of the Chicano Teatro and the one act play “acto.” In 1965, Váldez joined César Chávez and the United Farmworkers Union in drafting the | El Plan de Delano | , which proclaimed the principle of a movement for social justice. | Váldez brought together farm workers and students to form | El Teatro Campesino | in 1965 and toured union halls, the fields, and migrant camps. This idea of performing events of the day back to the workers was similar to the Living Newspaper of the WPA during the 1930s. | El Teatro | aimed to educate and inform the farm workers and the general public with social and political commentary intertwined with humor.  Their performances took the form of a one act play — “acto” — incorporating myth and history to document farm workers’ lives and aspirations. The “actos” dramatized political and social concerns, while “mitos” (myths) explored myths, legends, and spirituality. Originally based on the experiences of farm workers, their subject matter soon expanded to include other aspects of Chicano culture, history, and social issues. | El Teatro | set up headquarters in San Juan Bautista, located in San Benito County, just south of Santa Clara County. | A few years later, in 1974, | Teatro de La Gente | was created in the Bay Area as a theater of the people, involving people with no theater background, whether cannery workers, immigrants, or refugees.  As one of the few Chicano Theater groups in the Bay Area, | Teatro de la Gente | performed for political rallies, social rallies, fundraisers, cultural events, and programs at other colleges. Performing in the farm labor camps, they marched with the people, playing music and singing along, then performed on stage. Working with people with little or no theater background but a lot of life experience, they conducted workshops and classes for the community. | Teatro de La Gente | toured throughout the southwest, performing works that related to the daily experiences of Chicanos. | El Teatro | strengthened the spirit of people struggling to deal with complex social and economic issues and reinforced the connection with cultural expressions for others. The Teatro Festival, organized in 1973 by | Teatro de la Gente | , brought Chicano theater groups together from all over the United States, Mexico, and other parts of Latin America. The music that came out of the Farmworkers Movement chronicled  the struggle of the farm worker in song and verse. | El Teatro | also incorporated indigenous music from Mexico and popular music from Latin America. | The 1970s soon saw an explosion of Chicano theater on college campuses and in communities throughout the United States, with several annual Chicano theater festivals organized by El Teatro Campesino. | El Teatro Nacional de Aztlán | (The National Theater of Aztlán) was created by the Teatro Campesino and other Chicano Teatro groups in 1971. | El Teatro Urbano | was started in 1968 in South El Monte by Rene and Rosemary Rodriguez.  Inspired by Teatro Campesino and named by Luís Váldez, this led to the creation of a regional network of Teatro groups in Southern California. | El Centro Cultural de la Gente | El Centro Cultural de la Gente | (Peoples' Cultural Center) was created in 1973 in | San José, California.  El Centro was a collaboration between | El Teatro de la Gente | and other San José artists, actors, writers, poets, and visual artists. Teatro and non-Teatro musicians were also developing contemporary Chicano-Latino music. There was an explosion of cultural works produced during that time, including posters, drawings, paintings, musical arrangements, and compositions.  Artists of all types shared gallery and theater space and were encouraged to collaborate.  The Centro became the center for a multitude of San José Chicano artists presenting everything from visual arts exhibits to city-wide cultural events, and were influential in the development of San José City Arts and Events Programs. | 18  of | 22 | Jesús Manuel Mena Garza, Serigraphy Studio, Garza Personal Collection, From 1970-1975 Series.

In 1969 the Mexican American Liberation Art Front (MALAF), a Chicano artists’ collective in the Fruitvale District of Oakland, was one of the first Chicano art collectives in the United States. Founded by Chicano artists Malaquias Montoya, Manuel Hernandez, Rene Yanez, and art professor Esteban Villa, it was one of the main poster producers for various protest events and movements in the 1960s and  soon created a circle of artists and activists interested in political and cultural work. | In I970 the Royal Chicano Air Force (RCAF) was founded as the Rebel Chicano Arts Front | at Sacramento State. This was an artist’s collective run by Jose Montoya, Esteban Villa, and Richard Favela to support the arts in the Chicano community and to educate young people in arts, history, and culture. Their mission also included promoting political awareness, and support for César Chávez and the United Farm Workers.  In 1972, the RCAF created the Centro De Artistas Chicanos, a hub for community programs including La Nueva Raza Bookstore and Galeria Posada, RCAF Danzantes, RCAF Graphics and Design Center, and the Barrio Art Program for children.  Many of the artists involved were educators, writers, poets, and musicians who contributed Chicano civil rights activism and to the promotion of Chicano art history, literature, and culture. As artists and activists, the silkscreen posters they created were highly political, expressing community concerns and viewed as instruments of social change. | The Chicano Mural Movement | The Chicano Mural Movement began in the 1960s when murals appeared extensively in the Southwest as part of the national Chicano Movement.  While famous Mexican muralists such as Diego Rivera had created monumental public art, Chicano muralists used their work to increase the visibility of the Mexican American experience and to advance the Chicano Civil Rights Movement. Murals were painted on buildings, schools, churches, and other public areas in Mexican American barrios, or neighborhoods. Murals continued in their traditional role as a visual narrative, while recording significant social and political events. Traditional cultural icons and symbols were infused with new meaning when they depicted contemporary struggles.  In the 1960s and 1970s, many artists were Vietnam veterans and their murals incorporated images of war and loss, along with Mexican revolutionary figures, the struggles of immigrants, and social justice issues relevant to Mexican and Latino-Americans. | Although women artists were still in the minority as muralists, the Mujeres Muralistas (MM) in San Francisco was an all-women art collective founded in the 1970s by Patricia Rodriguez, Graciela Carillo, Consuela Mendez, and Irene Perez. Their intention was to celebrate the culture and contributions of Mexican American and Latina women and to recognize the talent of Latina artists. Their images celebrated Latina women artists and historical figures as well as everyday women in the community in their various roles as wives, mothers, and workers. Some in the Mexican community questioned their ability to handle the physically strenuous work, while others questioned their focus on the lives of women and images of beauty. Public acceptance of their art influenced a shift from the stark images of war and loss typically produced by male muralists to a broader range of themes and color palettes. The Women’s Movement had often overlooked the perspectives of non-Anglo American women, and The Mujeres Muralistas’ art recognized Latina women’s experiences as integral to representations of Mexican American culture and socio-political issues. | 20  of | 22 | Title : Nuestro Mural de la Raza | Photographer: Jose Meza and his wife Juanita Velasquez | Date: 1980s | Collection: Silicon Valley De-Bug | Owning Institution: José Meza | Source: Jose Meza | Additional Online Information | ¡Printing the Revolution!

Formed in the 1970s, they performed with various South Bay Teatro Chicano groups — including El Teatro Campesino — and were on stage at the Chicano Moratorium on August 29, 1970, when police violence broke up a peaceful demonstration. Their 1977 album, Música de Nuestra América, incorporated Latin American protest music influences on Chicana/o Movement musical style. | Chicano Literary Movement | The Chicano community was rediscovering the power of literature to communicate philosophies and experiences and inspire change. The poem “I am Joaquin,” | written | in 1967 by Chicano Nationalist leader Corky Gonzalez, was significant as an anthem for the Chicano Civil Rights Movement and was soon adapted into a short film directed by Luís Váldez. The poem reflects on the complicated relationship of Chicanos to America, with a heritage that incorporates Spanish, Aztec, American Indian, and European American sources. While fighting for integrated schools and equal access to education, the Chicano Civil Rights Movement strongly supported bilingual education, which was illegal in many states at the time. | A long history of colonization had created a rich oral tradition of storytelling, plays, and narrative songs called | corridos. | Indigenous oral traditions provided a way to express discontent with racial discrimination and envision an alternative future.  A powerful voice among Chicana writers is poet and publisher Lorna Dee Cervantes. Born in San Francisco and raised in downtown San José, | s | he started writing poetry as a teenager and was determined that her words would be accessible to readers like herself. In 1976, Cervantes founded MANGO Publications, the first to publish many famous Chicano writers, including Sandra Cisneros, Jimmy Santiago Baca, and Alberto Rios. | Numerous Chicano newspapers, activist organization newsletters, and scholarly and arts publications arose during this period.  These included papers such as | El Manchete, Bronce and La Palabra, | and | Que Tal | , a student newspaper. While some were short lived, they documented the concerns of diverse ethnic Mexican communities and interpreted the goals of the Chicano Civil Rights Movement for their audiences.  The Chicano Press Association, established in 1969, had twenty two members at its height, mostly in California. Quinto Sol of Berkeley, the first fully independent publishing house, was founded in 1967 at UC Berkeley by Octavio I. Romano. They published the interdisciplinary | El Grito: A Journal of Contemporary Mexican-American Thought, | the first national academic and literary journal ever published in the United States. | 21  of | 22 | Title : Teatro De La Gente | Photographer: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Date: 1970-1975 | Collection: JMM Garza Photo | Owning Institution: | Source: | Additional Online Information | The Music of Flor del Pueblo | Chicano Literature: The Theme Of Cultural Resistance | Chicano Poetry - Research Guides at Washington University in St. Louis | The California Lowriders: A Merging of Chicano Civil Rights and Culture | Cruising originally began in downtown San José until police diverted riders into the unincorporated Eastside, particularly near the intersection of Story and King Roads.  According to Jesus Flores, a car club historian, low-riding crowds grew on the Eastside. Similarly, in Los Angeles low-riders had been pushed off of Whittier Boulevard by new restrictions. Many ethnic Mexican Angelenos faced similar obstacles to those in Santa Clara County. Lowriders cruised up to Eastside San José in numbers that resulted in the creation of “No Cruising” zones. Low riding culture went underground until the City of San José lifted the City’s low-riding restriction in 2022. According to Smithsonian curator Steve Velasquez, during the Chicano Movement in the 1960s and 1970s, car clubs took on a politically empowered perspective, inviting family involvement and undertaking community events such as fundraising for the United Farm Workers labor union and hosting health initiatives. The car-culture aspect of low-riding was 10 percent, while the social aspect was 90 percent. | Mexican veterans had utilized mechanical skills learned in the military to modify older models and lowered the rears of the cars with weights in order to stylishly cruise the roads. So it was no surprise when San José introduced the use of hydraulics in the low-riding scene. In 1977, San José State University students Larry Gonzalez, Sonny Madrid, and David Nunez pooled their money and published the first | Low Rider Magazine | in a small store front on Willow Street in San José. Just as the Chicano Movement utilized mythical Aztec artistic designs reminiscent of Diego Rivera murals, so did low-rider car artists. Velasquez noted that car artistic expression became a tool of resistance, calling the cars “mobile canvases.” As noted in Smithsonian Magazine, low-riding became “the nexus between art and activism. | 22  of | 22 | Title : 2nd National Lowrider Car SHow & Car Hop Championship Advertisement | Photographer: | Date: 1979/06 | Collection: History San José Ephemera Collection | Owning Institution: History San Jose | Source: | Scholar Talk | Image | Additional Online Information | East Side Revelations - Lowriding | San José Public Library | California Low Riders, San José, 1978 | “San José’s History of Lowriding” | Low Riders in the Barrio 1979 | The Vibrant History of Lowrider Car Culture in L.A. | Travel | Smithsonian Magazine | Cruising for Community: Youth Culture and Politics in Los Angeles, 1910-1970. | Ph.D. Dissertation. Ides, Matthew Allan. 2009. | Previous | Next | Pre-1960 National Mexican American Advocacy Groups Continue in the 1960s and 1970s | League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) | The first nationally recognized ethnic Mexican advocacy group in the United States, LULAC incorporated naturalization and voter registration as key elements in their organizing. Established in 1929, LULAC leadership advocated for community rights and an end to discrimination suffered by Latin American citizens in the United States. LULAC is the oldest Hispanic civil rights organization in the U.S., with a large middle-class membership and focus on the rights of citizens, and is considered more conservative in their tactical approach.  In the 1960s LULAC supported national and local candidates and mobilized Mexican American voters and candidates for political office. | Community Service Organization (CSO) | Founded in 1947 as a national organization to protect the civil rights of Mexican Americans and encourage political and civic engagement, the CSO was formed primarily by community organizers.  Although it was a national organization, individual chapters played a critical role in developing local and state policies that impacted the labor and voting rights of Mexican Americans. The local San José CSO chapter (according to La Raza Historical Society of Santa Clara Valley) worked from 1955 to 1961 “to change statewide labor laws to enable Non-citizen Old Age Pensions in California.''  After César Chávez, Gilbert Padilla, and Dolores Huerta left the CSO in 1961 to form the United Farm Workers of America (UFWA), Lino Covarrubias and other San José leaders helped workers actually receive these benefits. | During the 1960s and 1970s, three voting rights bills would prove critical to LULAC and CSO activities. The Voting Rights Acts of 1965 outlawed discriminatory voting practices adopted after the Civil War, including literacy tests as a prerequisite to voting. The Voting Rights Act Amendment of 1970 lowered the voting age in national elections to 18. This encouraged young people to engage in political activity. All of these bills would foster the creation of more politically focused advocacy groups. Finally, the Voting Rights Act of 1975 provided assistance for “language minority” citizens, offering bilingual ballots and voting instructions, and assistance for blind, disabled, or illiterate voters. | American GI Forum | The American GI Forum (AGIF) had been established after WWII by returning ethnic Mexican veterans who faced discrimination when attempting to join established groups, such the Veterans of Foreign Wars, with largely white membership. AGIF became strong advocates for Mexican American/Latino veterans with the slogan \"Education is our freedom, and freedom should be everybody's business.\"  In contrast to other Mexican American/Latino groups created prior to WWII, such as LULAC, the GI Forum took political positions in opposition to the American political establishment. The AGIF leadership campaigned against the Bracero program, supported legal challenges to school segregation, and marched in solidarity with Chicano protesters. Between 1969 and 1979, the AGIF led a national boycott against the Adolph Coors Company, challenging the corporation's discriminatory employment practices. AGIF also sponsored Mexican cultural events and commemorations such as Cinco de Mayo and 16 de Septiembre in San José, the largest such events in California. | The San José Chapter of the AGIF was established June 6, 1949, by ethnic Mexican veterans of WWII.  In the 1950s, veterans from the Korean Conflict joined the chapter.  According to the Santa Clara County La Raza Historical Society, this chapter focused on bringing in community members to serve as counselors at the Santa Clara County William James Boys Juvenile Detention Ranch. By the 1960s, the San José Chapter and the newly formed Santa Clara Chapter (1961), with the associated Ladies Auxiliaries of the AGIF, joined together to sponsor community activities such as parades, fiestas, dances, queen competitions, and fashion shows, to raise scholarship money for ethnic Mexican students.  In addition they held an annual Black and White Ball fundraiser at the Cabana Hyatt House in Palo Alto, raising millions of dollars for their cause. | Title : “El Excentrico” Column GI Forum- Pat Vasquez | Date: 1966  April 5, | Collection: El Eccentrico | Owning Institution: California Room, San Jose Public Library | Source: Calisphere | 1966-04-05 Publisher: Bert Garcia ; El Excentrico | Additional Online Information | Chicano Movements: A Geographic History | LULAC | History | The League of United Latin-American Citizens: A Texas-Mexican Civic Organization | “The Search for a Civic Voice:  California Latino Politics” | Dr. Hector Garcia and The American GI Forum | American GI Forum of California Records | “Con Safos: A Chicano’s Journey Through Life in California” | Richard Martinez East Valley AGI Forum San Jose, CA 4/30/2022 | The Rise of Chicano Politics in the 1960s and 1970s | U.S policy | long encouraged immigrant assimilation, with new citizens expected to acquire English as their language and culture in order to become “American.”  In the United States, the term “Mexican” is a large category that encompasses American-born people of Mexican descent, immigrants from Mexico who have become naturalized citizens and Mexican nationals who reside in the United States but are not American citizens. | While some immigrants chose not to become citizens, reasoning that it might not make a difference in how they were treated, some ethnic Mexican organizations  supported naturalization. The first Mexican American organizations, during the pre-1960s period, advocated for citizenship and assimilation. During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of Mexican Americans questioned whether assimilation was possible or even desirable because of prevalent racism in the United States. | Equity in education remained a major issue, an obstacle to better jobs and a better life.  A new generation of ethnic Mexican college students uncovered their history and critically analyzed what they had been taught in public schools. At the same time, with the rise and successes of César Chávez, a sense of ethnic consciousness and unity grew around the farm labor movement. The Black Civil Rights Movement had also inspired many ethnic Mexicans to consider whether more direct strategies, moving from the courts to the streets, would be more effective in obtaining their legal rights under the U.S. Constitution. | Although ethnic Mexicans suffered the same types of economic, social, and political discrimination that African Americans and other people of color endured, there are  important differences.  American policies on immigration and citizenship affected all Mexicans. American-born Mexicans who had been deported during the Depression were suspected of taking jobs that could be offered to citizens. Ethnic Mexican families made up of  both citizens and undocumented immigrants faced the possibility of losing one or both parents to deportation.  Mexican immigrants tended to live in neighborhoods with other native language speakers in order to survive with their limited English.  Since bilingualism was not generally viewed as an asset, speaking Spanish could be an obstacle. | Some Chicanos viewed themselves as a colonized people, based on their belief that the United States government had failed to live up to the promise of full citizenship under the 1848 treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which had ended the war between the United States and Mexico. Mexican Americans were not accepted as fully American, but neither were they truly Mexican. Their closest identity was with Aztlán, the legendary original homeland in the Aztec migration stories, identified as the area of the Southwest conquered during the Mexican American War.  In this case, the terms | Chicano | and | Chicana | began to be viewed as a positive identity to express self-determination and political solidarity. | Title : Fiestas de las Rosas Riots/Arrest | Photographer: | SPIDER SANCHEZ AND JESUS MENA GARZA | Date: Printed May 1989 | Collection: AACNA & SJSU Martin Luther King Jr Special Collections | Owning Institution: AACNA | Additional Online Information | The Chicano Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and 1970s | During the 1930s and 1940s the African American and Mexican American Civil Rights Movements had worked closely together on legal strategies. Several decades later the African American Civil Rights Movements fight for equality in the South during the 1950s and 1960s inspired the Chicano Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and 1970s. While The Chicano Civil Rights Movement worked on many societal injustices, it focused on key issues of | land ownership, rural and urban workers' rights, artistic expression, and educational and political equality | . The Chicano Movement sought to | combat institutional racism, promote cultural autonomy, and work to guarantee equal labor and political rights | . This movement would spark a national conversation about the political and social autonomy of Mexican American/Latino groups everywhere in the United States. | The term | Hispanic | was popularized in the 1970s as a bureaucratic convenience to categorize all Spanish-speaking people in the United States. This term ignores the fact that there are many different cultural groups within the “Hispanic” label, each with their own history and experiences. Though the impact of the Chicano Movement was felt across the country, each region could have a different focus because of historical and cultural variations.  In the Southwest, particularly in Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, the majority of Spanish-speaking communities identified with a Spanish colonial past, rather than a Mexican immigrant history. | California, even with its origins as a Spanish and Mexican territory, was relatively isolated from the center of Mexican culture and government due to its geographically inaccessible deserts and mountains. During the California Gold Rush, the small population of Spanish New World colonists and their descendants were overwhelmed by immigrants from every nation, along with the Americans who soon dominated the state’s power structure and economy.  It was not until after the Mexican Revolution, World War II’s Bracero Program, and the post-War period that California saw large numbers of newly documented and undocumented immigrants residing in the state. | As a result, the Chicano Movement in California, established by the children and grandchildren of these pre-1960s Mexican immigrants, forged a new identity and increased their political influence by the use of the new, more confrontational tactics of the 1960s and 1970s. In the Santa Clara Valley, the original group of Spanish-speaking settlers has been continually renewed and enlarged over the last 150 years by immigrants from Mexico and Latin America and migrants from throughout the Southwest.  The largest group of Spanish-speaking immigrants has historically come from Mexico. | Title : Chicano Educational Pilgrimage | Photographer: Unknown | Date: Printed April 1989 | Collection: AACNA | Owning Institution: AACNA | Additional Online Information | Midcentury Migrations - FoundSF | How the Chicano Movement Championed Mexican-American Identity and Fought for Change | HISTORY | “Mexican Immigrants in the San Francisco Bay Area:  A Summary of Current Knowledge, 1982” file:///Users/scarlet-tanager/Downloads/ucsd024.pdf | From Servants To Engineers: Mexican Immigration And Labor Markets In The San Francisco Bay Area | Background on the Chicano Movement | Facing History & Ourselves | Making History: The Chicano Movement | El Movimiento: The Chicano Movement and Hispanic Identity in the United States – Pieces of History | The Chicano Rights Movement | Season 2018 | Episode 1 | PBS | The Chicano Movement: A Short Overview · South Texas Stories · Bell Library Exhibits | Chicano Oral History Projec | t | (SJSU Special Collections) | WOMEN IN THE CHICANO MOVEMENT: Grassroots Activism in San José | Chicano Movements: A Geographic History | The Ideology and Goals of The Chicano Civil Rights Movement, 1968-1969 | Chicano cultural nationalism was clearly expressed in the 1968 | El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán | , written by the | Denver, Colorado based Crusade for Justice, an ethnic Mexican civil rights and educational organization founded by Corky Gonzalez. Gonzalez was the author of the 1967 poem | I am Joaquin | , which expressed a critique of racism that requires assimilation and the denial of one’s roots.  It | states: | …that social, economic, cultural, and political independence is the only road to total liberation from oppression, exploitation, and racism. Our struggle then must be for the control of our barrios, campos, pueblos, lands, our economy, our culture, and our political life | The Plan promoted cultural nationalism, pride in Mexican culture, and the creation of independent Chicano political and economic institutions, with community control of schools, advocating for self-defense, and supporting militant protest. | The following year | , El Plan de Santa Barbara, A Chicano Plan for Higher Education | was written by the Chicano Coordinating Council on Higher Education, a group of students at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The 155-page document was created as a blueprint for the development of Chicana/o Studies programs in colleges and universities in the United States.  It would also become the foundation for the Chicano student group | Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán | ( | MEChA | ). | In 1969, students from twelve universities met at a conference in Santa Barbara, calling for the unification of all student and youth organizations into one organization to be called the | Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán | (MEChA).  This included the United Mexican American Students (UMAS), the Mexican American Student Conference (MASC), and the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO). These groups represented student chapters from middle schools through the university level. | Both | El Plan Espiritual | de Aztlán | and | El Plan de Santa Barbara | were later criticized for excluding women and the LGBT community, reflecting the biases of that time. For this reason, the goals of the Plan for achieving inclusivity are viewed as a work in progress, continually modified by generations of Chicanx scholars. | Title : Protest Against Vietnam War - College students and other people marching | \"VENCEREMOS!

In 1970, MALDEF successfully challenged a Texas legislative initiative that had created “mega districts,” which the U.S. Supreme Court later ruled unconstitutional for inhibiting minority voter participation. This ruling led to the Voting Rights Act of 1975. | Southwest Council of La Raza (SCLR) | The Southwest Council of La Raza (SCLR)  was founded in 1968 in Phoenix, Arizona, by Herman Gallegos, Dr. Julian Samora, and Dr. Ernesto Galarza with the goal of reducing poverty and discrimination, and to improve life opportunities for Latino Americans. Their initial efforts were focused on the Southwestern states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado. In 1972 they opened a national headquarters in Washington, D.C. with a new name, the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), which reflected their expansion into communities across the United States. These actions supported advocacy, developed resources, and helped strengthen Hispanic community-based organizations. | Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP) | One of the most successful advocacy groups was founded in 1974 by William C. Velásquez. The goal of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP) was to mobilize and empower the Latino community by facilitating voter registration drives and initiating legal challenges. By 1988 a total of 75 lawsuits had been filed to help undo gerrymandering and eliminate language barriers and other voter suppression practices. | Title : MALDEF The Fight for Mexican -American Rights | Photographer: Aubrey Haines | Date: July 05,1978 | Collection: El Eccentrico | Owning Institution: Garcia, Bert | Source: SJ Public Library | Additional Online Information | History | MALDEF | Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund | Civil Rights, Education & Advocacy | Britannica | National Council of La Raza Records | Southwest Council of La Raza (SWCLR), 1968 | New Mexico Archives Online | 1974: Southwest Voter Registration Education Project - A Latinx Resource Guide: Civil Rights Cases and Events in the United States | Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP) | Library of Congress | National Chicano Advocacy Groups: The Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) and the La Raza Unida Party (LRUP), 1970s | La Raza Unida Party (LRUP) created the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) in Crystal City, Texas, as part of Plan de Aztlán.

Inspired by the Black Civil Rights Movement and by leaders Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X, LRUP was a Mexican American third party movement that supported candidates for elective office in Texas, California, and eventually in other areas of the Southwest and Midwest. | Ernesto Galarza, then teaching in Santa Clara County, was elected Chairman of the La Raza Unida Party Conference at an organizational meeting in 1967. La Raza Unida began as a loose confederation of Latino/Mexican American civic, social, and cultural groups whose representatives were in El Paso to attend hearings of the U.S. Cabinet Committee on Mexican American Affairs. By their second conference in San Antonio in January 1968, chapters were being organized throughout the United States. While LRUP achieved some local success in elective offices in Texas, its greatest accomplishment was to inspire greater participation in the electoral process and advocate for the interests of the Latino community. | Title : Chicano Student Rally | Photographer: Spartan Daily News | Date: 1968 -10-11 | Collection: Spartan Daily Negatives Collection | Owning Institution: San Jose State University Library Special Collections & Archive | Source: SJSU King Library Digital Collections | Additional Online Information | A BRIEF HISTORY OF LA RAZA UNIDA PARTY | The historical legacy of the Raza Unida Party | The California-Mexico Studies Center, Inc. | Raza Unida Party Chapters 1970-1974 - Mapping American Social Movements | UNITED WE WIN: The Rise and Fall of La Raza Unida.

The establishment of CRU was a direct result of a violent confrontation between police and protestors at the | Fiesta de Las Rosas | (FDLR) celebration in San José on June 1, 1969. | The FDLR was a floral parade during the late 1920s that celebrated the city and | county’s mythical Spanish heritage with floats and people in costume. The event had not been held since 1933 due to the Great Depression, and the idea was revived in 1966 as an event that would help revitalize a declining downtown San José. While some members of the ethnic Mexican community supported the event, others asked them to boycott the event, explaining that it ignored the fact that many ethnic Mexican neighborhoods still lacked adequate housing or public services. An estimated 75,000 people attended the event, including 100 protestors, representing some 35 San Francisco Bay Area Chicano organizations.  Police charged the protestors as they assembled to join the parade, claiming that the protestors attacked, forcing the police to use riot tactics. As portrayed in the media, the confrontation reinforced stereotypes of ethnic Mexicans as criminals and trouble makers. | After their encounter with the police, the protestors gathered at Guadalupe Church on the Eastside to discuss the event and decided that a coalition group was needed to deal with the interrelated issues they faced. Within a year the CRU had opened an office in downtown San José, representing a majority of organizations in Santa Clara County working with the Spanish-speaking community. By 1971 the CRU represented over 200,000 ethnic Mexicans in Santa Clara County, with members from various political, civic, religious, and educational backgrounds. | Title: Rodolfo “ Corky” Gonzales | Photographer: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Date: 1970-1975 | Collection: JMMGarza Photos | Owning Institution: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Source: | https://jmmgarza.com/chicano-photographer | Additional Online Information | Confederacion de la Raza Unida v.

She was one of the pioneers who built the Chicano Movement for civil rights and equal justice here. Attached is an article we received from her daughter, Doreen Garcia Nevel. A reprint from the East Side Sun, it appeared in El Excentrico Magazine | “Hearings Before the Subcommittee To Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws” Part 22, 1971, Statement of Jack Ibarra, President of Confederation de La Raza Unida, San Jose, California: | Local Chapters of National Advocacy Groups: United Farm Workers (UFW) | Farm workers had been specifically excluded from the protection of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 because Southern Congressmen did not want to enable labor organizing among Southern Black agricultural and domestic workers.  American farm workers were not guaranteed the right to organize and had no guaranteed minimum wage.  Without federal protection, state laws that applied to farm workers were largely ignored. | In Santa Clara County, as in many parts of California, the majority of agricultural laborers were people of color living at the poverty level, often Spanish speaking with limited English skills, whose children might also be employed.  Agricultural work was seasonal, so migrant laborers followed the harvests from one region to another, making them a difficult group to organize. | Another major obstacle was the Bracero Program, Public Law 78, started during WWII as a temporary agreement between the United States and Mexico to recruit  workers to relieve a labor shortage.  The program continued until 1973 with the encouragement of local growers. Legally, no bracero could replace a domestic worker, though this provision was rarely enforced. Bracero workers could be used as strikebreakers and could be paid less, which depressed farm workers’ wages in general. | In the decades immediately prior to the creation of the United Farm Workers Association (UFWA), two organizations had tried to organize farm workers in California. The Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee had been formed in 1959 by the AFL-CIO based on the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), which Dolores Huerta helped to found | in 1960 while continuing to work with the CSO in Stockton. | AWOC was largely composed of Filipinos, Chicanos, Anglos. and Black workers, and led by experienced Filipino field organizer Larry Itliong. | The National Farm Workers of America (NFWA) had been started by former Community Service Organization (CSO) organizers César Chávez, Dolores Huerta, and Gilbert Padilla in 1962. Beginning as an organizer in San José in 1952, Chávez, who had grown up as a farm worker, had risen through the ranks to become national director of the CSO. Although the CSO worked with local communities to identify and resolve urban problems, it was not interested in organizing farm workers, so Chávez, Huerta, and Padilla left in 1962 to found the NFWA. | At the end of the summer in 1965, farm workers with the AWOC demanded $1.25 per hour to pick the grape crop. When growers refused, on September 8, workers at nine farms went on strike.  Growers then brought in strikebreakers, and the AWOC asked the NFWA to join the strike. On September 16, the NFWA voted unanimously to strike, and asked the public not to | buy grapes without a union label.  NFWA and AWOC merged to become the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee, AFL-CIO (UFWOC) and the grape boycott became one of their first joint efforts. | Born in Delano, Luís Váldez had returned to help the farm worker movement in 1965 after graduating from SJSU.  That year, he created El Teatro Campesino (The Farmworkers Theater). | The following year, Váldez, Dolores Huerta, and César Chávez drafted the | El Plan de Delano | , which framed the farm labor movement as a nonviolent revolution for social justice.  UFWOC, as Chávez had envisioned, had become both a union and a civil rights movement. | I | n 1975, renamed the United Farm Workers (UFW), they won the passage of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, a landmark agreement recognizing the right of farm workers in California to organize. | In the face of continued opposition from the government and agribusiness, farm workers and Chicano student activists organized one of the largest labor rights campaigns in U.S. Farm Labor history, which was a significant milestone for the Chicano Movement. | The Civil Rights Movement had, in more than two centuries of struggle, increased public awareness of the effects of racism against people of color, such as lower standards of living and discrimination in housing, employment, schools, voting, and everyday life. While the Civil Rights Movement had focused on the treatment of Blacks in America, the struggle for farm labor rights in California showed that this was also a struggle for civil rights. Because of César Chávez’s connection to Santa Clara County during the 1950s through his residency and his work with the Community Service Organization, Chávez maintained close ties during his UFW years. He often worked with Guadalupe Church, the CSO, and his sister Rita Chávez Medina during his UFW campaigns. | Title : Marcher With La Virgen | Photographer: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Date: 1970-1975 | Collection: JMM Garza Photos | Owning Institution: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Source: | https://jmmgarza.com/chicano-photographer | Scholar Talk | Additional Online Information | UFW History | 1962: United Farm Workers Union - A Latinx Resource Guide: Civil Rights Cases and Events in the United States | The Farm Worker Movement | PBS LearningMedia | Cesar Chavez: American Civil Rights Activist - Fast Facts | History | American History Tellers | United Farm Workers: Birth of a Movement | Podcast | American History Tellers | United Farm Workers: The Fall | Podcast | Decline of the Canneries and Impact on Local Ethnic Mexican Population Led to Local Chicano Advocacy | With the rise of Silicon Valley in the 1960s, Valley canneries were in decline due to the postwar transition from an agricultural to a technological/industrial economy.  Technology was a booming field which attracted both local residents and new immigrants to the Valley, also contributing to a housing shortage.  Agricultural employment declined as farmers sold entire orchards for real estate and industrial development. Consequently, many local canneries closed during this period.  Though Mexican workers found local employment in urban construction and suburban domestic work, they were not as successful on the assembly lines of Silicon Valley’s emerging tech industry. | In 1967, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act required that jobs not be gendered into “male” or “female” work. Title VII afforded more opportunities for women to work in warehousing and shipping, occupations traditionally reserved for men.  Although cannery women’s benefits were lower than men’s,, in the 1970s and 1980s cannery work offered women stability, enabling many women to become homeowners and create worker neighborhoods, according to sociologist Patricia Zavella. Historian Glenna Matthews notes that this changed when the Teamsters took cannery representation away from the American Federation of Labor (AFL).  In the 1970s and 1980s César Chávez’s new organization, the United Farm Workers of America (UFWA), created a legal project called “The Cannery Workers Committee” (CWC) to protest Teamster discriminatory treatment.  Using the Civil Rights Act Title VII, the CWC won a number of cases that enabled ethnic Mexican cannery women to move from seasonal line work to higher paying, permanent warehouse-related cannery jobs. | By 1976, most cannery jobs were unionized, providing ethnic Mexican women with wage, medical, holiday and retirement benefits.  Technology workers were not as fortunate, holding jobs that were not unionized, providing none of the benefits. By 1987, there were only eight canneries left in the Santa Clara County, and by 1999 Del Monte had closed Plant #3, the world’s largest cannery operation. The demise of the canneries took access to well-paid union jobs with their opportunities for advancement away from ethnic Mexican workers. | Jesús Manuel Mena Garza, Del Monte Pickles , Garza Personal Collection, From 1970-1975 Series.

The largest concentration of ethnic Mexicans in Santa Clara County resided in the unincorporated area of San Jose’s developing Eastside. Downtown San José, adjacent to the historic downtown Mexican | colonia | , became the hub of a vibrant regional business and entertainment district that drew Spanish-speaking clients residing in the Eastside | colonia, | worker neighborhoods in surrounding towns, and smaller unincorporated communities of Santa Clara County. | Between 1960 and 1970 the population of Santa Clara County grew by 66%, with Spanish-surnamed residents growing from 12% to 18%. As the most-populated municipality in the County, housing the largest number of ethnic Mexicans, San José continued to serve as the center for social, cultural, and political activity for ethnic Mexicans in the South Bay.  Unlike other urban areas, where “white flight” resulted in a declining urban core, the ethnic Mexican population settled in these areas, starting businesses and raising families. Annexation of the Eastside into the City of San José did not immediately bring needed improvements in streets, water or sewage systems. This was because San José had long relied on municipal bonds for civic improvements rather than raising taxes, which gave the growing city only sporadic access to funds. | San José had grown exponentially, from 17 square miles in 1920 to 120 in 1970, sprawling toward nearby towns such as Cupertino and Sunnyvale. Annexation of adjacent communities soon converted orchards, farms, and canning and packing operations to technology/industrial parks and housing tracts. These growing communities now prioritized access to public services and infrastructure improvements. | The 1958 the “Master Plan of the City of San José” fell in line with the goals of President Lyndon Baines Johnson’s anti-poverty programs of the 1960s. The federal Model Cities Program identified the central business district as crucial to the City’s growth and economy and one of its chief objectives for the City’s central core included an urban renewal program. The aim of the Model Cities Plan for urban renewal was to prevent existing blight from spreading, rehabilitate areas that could be restored, and to clear and rebuild those that were not “worth” saving (worth being a subjective term).  The Redevelopment Agency’s first major urban renewal project in San José during 1967 was Park Center Plaza.  Thirteen blocks encompassing nearly all of the west-of-Market neighborhood next to the center of downtown would eventually displace 466 mostly ethnic Mexican residents and 136 businesses. In 1968, San José applied for additional monies through the Model Cities Program. | In 1970 four assembly districts that received federal Model Cities Program funding were in the predominantly ethnic Mexican neighborhoods of Mayfair, Tropicana, Olinder, and Gardner. Existing worker housing near fruit processing plants and canneries downtown and in the Eastside were identified to be cleared as part of the Plan. | These ethnic Mexican neighborhoods also stood in the way of freeway expansion for Highways 280 and 680. The resulting demolition of blocks of existing residences and small businesses caused the displacement of local residents and the further fragmentation of older ethnic Mexican neighborhoods.  Local residents questioned the definition of “blighted” and whether one of the criteria were the higher numbers of people who spoke little or no English. Homes and businesses in this area were often sold for less than fair market value, so options for purchasing other property were extremely limited. | In response, the younger generation of Chicano organizers expected more action from their local government now that ethnic Mexicans also served on municipal councils and commissions. They were skeptical of large federal programs such as the Model Cities Programs and lobbied and mobilized in the streets to address issues such as discrimination in housing, institutional racism, police brutality, healthcare access, and labor rights. New organizations like the Brown Berets, United People Arriba (UPA), and the Community Alert Patrol (CAP) reflected efforts by these younger Chicano groups to focus directly on these issues on a local level. | Despite legal challenges to the Model Cities Program, redevelopment plans were generally supported by city residents who believed that they were necessary in order to create a stable local economy and safer neighborhoods. | Jesús Manuel Mena Garza, SJ Redevelopment, Garza Personal Collection, From 1970-1975 Series.

Before WWII, most ethnic Mexicans attended public school only up to the 8th grade. After WWII, ethnic Mexican students attended public high school, and some even enrolled in college. Public education for immigrant groups typically emphasized Americanization, prioritizing English skills and useful trades. Although segregated schools were no longer legal in California after the 1947 | Mendez v. Westminster | case, schools in Mexican neighborhoods were often older facilities with fewer resources, and few had Spanish-speaking teachers. Ethnic Mexican high school students were not tracked to college.  Frances Palacios, | who attended San José public schools | , | described a meeting with her high school counselor: “I told him what I wanted to take. When I did, he told me I didn't have the brains for it and would probably fall through, and to continue taking typing and filing. So, I did. I didn't take any college prep courses, because he felt I was incapable” (Frances Palacios, Chicano Oral History College, Special Collections, SJSU Library). Palacios eventually earned a BA and an MA in order to become a high school counselor who would help ethnic Mexican students go to college. | Local ethnic Mexican parents became increasingly concerned about the poor quality of education that their children received. At Roosevelt Junior High School in San José, parents found that the police assigned to the school harassed ethnic Mexican students, and these children received discriminatory treatment from both teachers and other students. The parents pressured the school district and succeeded in replacing 36 teachers, a principal, and a vice principal.  Despite the new faculty, the parents were still fighting structural inequality in the school system.  Similar to other ethnic Mexican high school students throughout the U.S. in the 1960s, and in particular in 1967 Los Angeles (the first such action in California), students at Roosevelt Junior High School organized a “Blow Out” (or walkout) to resolve the educational inequalities. | The Chicano Movement established an empowering political and cultural identity that was both Mexican and American.  Chicano students of all ages in Santa Clara County might be involved concurrently in local community organizations like United People | Arriba | (UPA – United People Upward) and the Brown Berets (BB), and in student-led groups like the Student Initiative (SI), the Mexican American Student Confederation (MASC), Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO), and the United Mexican American Students (UMAS). Meeting with other Chicano student groups and other students of color, they found common ground with young activists throughout California and across the nation. | A chapter of | MAYO was | started at San José High School with the help of organizer Lino Lopez in 1968. At that time Lopez worked with Mexican American youth and local schools in Santa Clara County to create bilingual programs. | MAYO, founded in 1967 in San Antonio, Texas, stressed Chicano cultural nationalism and direct political confrontation, using mass demonstrations involving both university students and teenagers to accomplish its goals. | Title : Sofi Mendoza; United People Arriba | Photographer: Unknown | Date: Unknown | Collection: AACNA SJSU Martin Luther King Jr. Library Special Collection | Owning Institution: AACNA Center | Source: East Side Dreams | Additional Online Information | Mexican-American School Walkout Focused on Problem June 26, 1970 | VOCES | MAYO | Season 2016 | Episode 1 | PBS | 5th Annual Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) Conference (San Francisco, CA) | California Revealed | (1962) Mexican-American Youth Organization (MAYO) Speech #chicana #chicano #mexicanamerican #latina | The Chicano Rights Movement | Season 2018 | Episode 1 | PBS | Jack Brito Part 4/8: San José Schools & Roosevelt Jr. High Protests 8/15/2014 | San José's Proud Legacy of Struggle for Chicano Rights : Indybay | San José Local Groups Fight Discrimination in College Education | After WWII and during the 1950s, ethnic Mexican civil rights organizations focused on providing scholarships, reducing high school dropout rates, and promoting college recruitment to help Mexican Americans professionalize, with the aim that educated workers would then give back to their communities.  Returning veterans attended college on the GI Bill, and some applied their degrees to education and social services. During the 1960s and 1970s, Mexican American students pursued a new direction, calling themselves “Chicanos” and creating new ethnic Mexican civil rights organizations emphasizing cultural nationalism. | Most ethnic Mexicans chose to attend the more affordable community colleges before transferring into four year colleges or universities.  San José City College (SJCC) served as such a launching ground. In 1965, Los Amigos, a student organization at San José City College, was founded primarily by young returning veterans to improve educational programs and to keep students in school, working with middle and high school students. Los Amigos programs also dealt with at-risk youth in Juvenile Hall. In 1966, the GI Bill was expanded to include Vietnam War veterans, and many of these older students attended community colleges. At San José City College, students organized tutoring programs and cultural activities and advocated for better educational opportunities.  When these students moved on to four-year colleges and universities, they continued their activism. | In the 1950s, San José State University (SJSU) was considered a conservative university in its views on race and class. This changed rapidly when ethnic Mexican students of color transferred from the more affordable San José City College to SJSU in the 1960s. The transfer students brought a host of student-led initiatives and activism with them, enabling and leading student demonstrations, walkouts, and picketing.  These activities led to the establishment of a counseling center and services for Chicano students prior to the creation of the Equal Opportunity Program (EOP) at SJSU. | In 1966, SJSU student Armando Valdez | o | rganized Student Initiative (SI), the first Chicano student organization at San José State. SI was dedicated to developing Mexican American student leadership and working with the campus Equal Opportunity Program (EOP). SI began working with local community groups and recruiting high school students to attend recruitment and orientation events at SJSU. Networking with other Chicano student groups statewide, SI transformed into the Mexican American Student Confederation (MASC), advocating for changes in the SJSU curriculum and textbooks, and for the creation of a Mexican American studies program at SJSU.  Bilingual education was also a major focus, with Ernesto Galarza serving as a non-faculty advocate.  In 1968 SI organized the Chicano Commencement walkout, protesting the low  Chicano student enrollment and low numbers of Chicano faculty. This walkout was the first protest by Mexican American students on a college campus in California. | In 1968, equity in education was still a major priority for the ethnic Mexican community, and many different student organizations had been started in high schools and colleges to support these students. Often, parents and teachers were deeply involved in these groups. The Mexican American Student Confederation (MASC) at SJSU created summer cultural programs to teach junior high school students Mexican visual art, music, dances, and cooking. They created the Mexican American Culture Center, which was established in 1999 at Mexican Heritage Plaza. MASC transformed into the Students for the Advancement of Mexican Americans (SAMA). | This same year, a student strike at San Francisco State College was organized by the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF), demanding the creation of a Department of Raza Studies under the School of Ethnic Studies as well as open admission to all students of color. This event, which had led to violent confrontations between students and police, prompted Mexican Americans and other third world student activists to form a rainbow coalition in which many San José State University (SJSU) and Santa Clara University Chicano students participated. | These protests led to the establishment of the Chicano Studies Program at SJSU, the oldest Graduate Program in Chicana/o Studies in the country, and catalyzed a push for a separate Chicano Commencement.  Among the groups pressing for change at SJSU were the Chicano Vietnam War veterans who were activated by the anti-Vietnam War Movement and returning to school on the GI Bill. Students like Victor Garza, now Dean at Evergreen Valley College, and Ramon Martinez, retired teacher, principal, and administrator in San José Unified School District, reached out to local high schools to encourage students to attend college, and to come to SJSU. | In the 1960s, Chicano student activists organized on college campuses throughout Santa Clara County, California, and across the nation. SJSU students Luís Váldez, a scholarship recipient in math and physics, and Roberto Rubalcava j oined the Marxist Progressive Labor Party (PLP) and traveled to Cuba in 1964 as part of a PLP delegation.  While many of their contemporaries embraced the more conservative political approach of accommodation and assimilation in American society held by the previous generation, Váldez and Rubalcava took a more radicalized approach to politics. | Together they produced the first Mexican American radical manifesto, “Venceremos!: Mexican American Statement on Travel to Cuba,” diverging from older Mexican American middle class civil rights organizations’ assimilationist policies. Váldez changed his major to Theater and joined the anti-establishment radical theater group the San Francisco Mime Troupe upon graduation, where he would continue his critique of assimilation tactics. | In 1965, Váldez participated in César Chávez’s farm worker organizing efforts in Delano, and wrote the Plan de Delano, which promoted the principle of organizing for social justice. That same year, Váldez founded the Teatro Campesino, recruiting its members from among Chicano student activists in northern California. | Dr. Carlos Muñoz, founding chair of the first Chicano Studies Department in the nation in 1968 at the California State University at Los Angeles and founding chair of the National Association of Chicana & Chicano Studies (NACCS), credits Luís Váldez and the cultural work of the Teatro Campesino for many of the concepts of Chicano identity and the emergence of the Generación Chicana. | Title : | Photographer: | Date: | Collection: El Eccentrico | Owning Institution: | Source: | Additional Online Information | 50th Chicano Reunion San Jose State: Original '68 Walkout Students, In Memorium Part 3/3 11/4/2023 | SJSU to Host Revisiting the 1968 Chicano Commencement Symposium Oct. 11 | SJSU forum focuses on 50th anniversary of Chicano activists' walkout | 1960s-Era Chicano Student Activists Celebrate Historic SJSU Graduation Protest - CBS San Francisco | San Jose recalls Chicano protest | SJSU News | San José State University Chicano Oral History Collection | SJSU Chicano Student History 1970s:  Ramon J.

In 1963 the Community Improvement Center (CIC) began as a self-help program. Sofia Mendoza started working with the CIC in 1963 and was a founding member of  Community Alert Patrol (CAP). She remembered, “We just had it. We had reached our limit. The police had guns, mace and billy clubs. They were always ready to attack us. It seemed as if nobody could stop what the police were doing” ( | Roots of Social Justice Organizing in Silicon Valley). | CAP was created to deal with complaints of police harassment and brutality, similar to the Black Panthers in Oakland. Close to a thousand local residents were trained to observe and record police interactions with the public, the most active participants being San José State University students involved in organizing for ethnic studies classes. | Community Progress League (CPL) | The CIC evolved into the Community Progress League (CPL) by 1965, with Sofia Mendoza leading the campaign to work with parents at Theodore Roosevelt Junior High in the ethnic Mexican Mayfair neighborhood.  As discussed in section 6.4, several ethnic Mexican children told their parents that other students and even some teachers had used racial epithets against them. These children had been reluctant to talk and Mendoza encouraged other parents to become involved. Eventually several teachers and the principal were replaced.  Despite the new staff, ethnic Mexican parents and some teachers felt other changes were needed in the curriculum and support system for their children.  They organized a student blowout/walkout in 1967 at Roosevelt Junior High, which was an inspiration for the LA “Blowouts” (walkouts) and the Chicano Moratorium March the following year. | United People | Arriba | (UPA – United People Upward) | The success of the walkout encouraged the group to create United People Arriba ( | Upward | ) (UPA) in 1967, which broadened the scope of membership and concerns to include multiple groups and issues. Mendoza and co-organizer Fred Hirsch lead the group.  Mendoza recalled, | “We wanted an organization that was not limited to one ethnic group, that would organize our entire community, so we called ourselves United People Arriba—United People Upward. We liked the term ‘United People’ because it got the idea across that people from different ethnic backgrounds were coming together in San Jose to work for social change—Blacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and whites working together in one organization” | ( | Roots of Social Justice Organizing in Silicon Valley). | One hundred thirty people attended their first meeting, many of whom had been involved with the school walkout. They developed a committee system to deal with multiple issues: improving local health services, challenging discriminatory education, expanding welfare rights, monitoring policing tactics, and increasing employment and better housing. | Title : Sofia | Photographer: Unknwon | Date: 1950s | Collection: San José Public Library California Room | Owning Institution: San Jose Public Library | Source: Revelations Spotlighting East San José by Shane Curtin and Estella Inda | Additional Online Information | Roots of Social Justice Organizing in Silicon Valley | Reimagine! | The Chicana Civil Rights Activist Who Helped Transform San José Housing - KQED Pop | East Side Revelations - Sofia Mendoza | San José Public Library | East San José Celebrates the Life of Sofia Mendoza | SOFIA MENDOZA | Sofia Mendoza Women Leaders of San José, CA The 1960's & 1970's Part 1/3  4/24/2010 | In Memory of Fred Hirsch | Local 393 | Fred Hirsch: Doing the Work That Needed To Be Done | Convergence | Guide to the Fred Hirsch Ephemera Collection | Fred Hirsch | Expanding Community Advocacy in Santa Clara County With CIC, CAP, CPL And UPA | The Mexican American Community Services Agency, Inc. (MACSA) was organized in 1964 by Santa Clara County ethnic Mexican activists to identify ways to respond to the discrimination, racism, poverty, police brutality, educational inequity, and inadequate access to public services that existed in Silicon Valley.  Their methods emphasized self-help, coalition building, and neighborhood organizing based on the model established by the Community Services Organization (CSO) of the 1950s. Young people were of particular concern to MACSA because many students were afraid to complain to their parents about the harassment and discriminatory treatment they experienced in schools. Compounding the problem were prevailing attitudes held by many ethnic Mexican parents who saw teachers as authority figures who were not to be questioned. MACSA, however, was broadly successful in focusing its efforts on youth, families, and senior outreach with targeted educational cultural activities and programs. In addition, MACSA developed nutrition programs as well as employment and training programs at youth centers, schools, libraries, and community sites. | Title : La Voz Estudiantil, Volume 1, No.3 (Getting People Together) | Photographer: Unknown | Date: 1983 | Collection: San Jose State Scholarworks AACNA Digital Collections | Owning Institution: SJSU Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library | Source: San Jose State University , Mexican American Graduate Studies | Additional Online Information | Local Community Advocacy: Brown Berets and Black Berets in San José | In 1967, David Sanchez dissolved Young Citizens for Community Action to form the Brown Berets (BB), a self-defense group based in East Los Angeles. The BB was known as a militant youth group that protested educational neglect and police brutality, and had strong links to the community and to East LA high school. Together, BB members and students began a series of pickets in front of sheriffs’ offices and police stations. | San José’s Brown Berets were organized in the same year and based on the East LA group and Oakland’s Black Panther Party.  The Panthers were a Marxist–Leninist and black power political group founded by college students Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton in October 1966. San José’s Brown Berets described their mission as protecting the Chicano community from police brutality, promoting equal employment, housing, education, and voting rights, as well as protecting the right to bear arms, and as advocates for bilingual education.  They often provided security for protest marches and community events, buffering these groups from potential police harassment. | Other organizations took up a black beret and called themselves the Black Berets, in honor of Che Guevara. Their perspective was anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist, and internationalist. They created and assisted in many community programs such as food distribution, community patrols, and other activities. While most active in other areas of the Southwest, the Black Berets in San José also made alliances with other groups, and provided security for the Roosevelt Junior High School walkout in 1967. | Title : Boycott Gallo (Brown Berets Present in the March) | Photographer: Unknown | Date: Possibly 1970’s | Collection: AACNA Digital Collections | Owning Institution: San Jose State University Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library | Source: AACNA  Digital Collections | Additional Online Information | \"To Protect and To Serve: Effects of the Relationship Between the Brown\" by Paul Flores | Brown Berets Hail 'La Raza' and Scorn the Establishment June 16, 1969 | FACEism: Footage shows clash between police, East LA protesters who changed the Chicano movement | Carlos Montes oral history interview conducted by David P.

The mix of cultural influences that were considered inferior to White Americans was a central concept for the Chicano Movement. These beliefs reflected the forging of a unique identity, one that crossed borders and cultures. | The 1960s were marked by cultural nationalist struggles in the Third World and an international student movement. The US also reflected this generational change with the emergence of multiple social and political movements, including domestic Black Power, hippie counterculture, and massive mobilization against the war in Vietnam. The national flowering of the Chicano Arts Movement in the US found expression in a  variety of mediums, including Theater, Painting/Murals, Music, and Literature. Artists composed slogans of solidarity and envisioned art and culture as crucial aspects of social transformation. Chicano arts would reinforce a positive identity and fortify the community. The Chicano Civil Rights Movement reaffirmed a centuries-long struggle for human and cultural rights | Title : Centro Cultural De La Gente | Photographer: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Date: 1970-1975 | Collection: JMM Garza Photo | Owning Institution: JMMGARZA.com | Additional Online Information | “The History of Mexican Americans in California” (include Chicano Cultural Movement) | Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California (Mexican Americans) | The California Chicano Cultural Movement:  Chicano Theater Movement | El Teatro Campesino | El Teatro Campesino | (The Farmworkers’ Theater), one of the most influential elements of the Chicano Arts Movement, has its roots in San José.  San José State College students Luís Váldez and Roberto Rubalcava joined the Marxist Progressive Labor Party (PLP) and traveled to Cuba in 1964 as part of a PLP delegation. Váldez joined the anti-establishment radical theater group the San Francisco Mime Troupe upon graduation. He was introduced to guerilla theater and Italian Commedia dell'arte, forms which would influence the development of the Chicano Teatro and the one act play “acto.” In 1965, Váldez joined César Chávez and the United Farmworkers Union in drafting the | El Plan de Delano | , which proclaimed the principle of a movement for social justice. | Váldez brought together farm workers and students to form | El Teatro Campesino | in 1965 and toured union halls, the fields, and migrant camps. This idea of performing events of the day back to the workers was similar to the Living Newspaper of the WPA during the 1930s. | El Teatro | aimed to educate and inform the farm workers and the general public with social and political commentary intertwined with humor.  Their performances took the form of a one act play — “acto” — incorporating myth and history to document farm workers’ lives and aspirations. The “actos” dramatized political and social concerns, while “mitos” (myths) explored myths, legends, and spirituality. Originally based on the experiences of farm workers, their subject matter soon expanded to include other aspects of Chicano culture, history, and social issues. | El Teatro | set up headquarters in San Juan Bautista, located in San Benito County, just south of Santa Clara County. | A few years later, in 1974, | Teatro de La Gente | was created in the Bay Area as a theater of the people, involving people with no theater background, whether cannery workers, immigrants, or refugees.  As one of the few Chicano Theater groups in the Bay Area, | Teatro de la Gente | performed for political rallies, social rallies, fundraisers, cultural events, and programs at other colleges. Performing in the farm labor camps, they marched with the people, playing music and singing along, then performed on stage. Working with people with little or no theater background but a lot of life experience, they conducted workshops and classes for the community. | Teatro de La Gente | toured throughout the southwest, performing works that related to the daily experiences of Chicanos. | El Teatro | strengthened the spirit of people struggling to deal with complex social and economic issues and reinforced the connection with cultural expressions for others. The Teatro Festival, organized in 1973 by | Teatro de la Gente | , brought Chicano theater groups together from all over the United States, Mexico, and other parts of Latin America. The music that came out of the Farmworkers Movement chronicled  the struggle of the farm worker in song and verse. | El Teatro | also incorporated indigenous music from Mexico and popular music from Latin America. | The 1970s soon saw an explosion of Chicano theater on college campuses and in communities throughout the United States, with several annual Chicano theater festivals organized by El Teatro Campesino. | El Teatro Nacional de Aztlán | (The National Theater of Aztlán) was created by the Teatro Campesino and other Chicano Teatro groups in 1971. | El Teatro Urbano | was started in 1968 in South El Monte by Rene and Rosemary Rodriguez.  Inspired by Teatro Campesino and named by Luís Váldez, this led to the creation of a regional network of Teatro groups in Southern California. | El Centro Cultural de la Gente | El Centro Cultural de la Gente | (Peoples' Cultural Center) was created in 1973 in | San José, California.  El Centro was a collaboration between | El Teatro de la Gente | and other San José artists, actors, writers, poets, and visual artists. Teatro and non-Teatro musicians were also developing contemporary Chicano-Latino music. There was an explosion of cultural works produced during that time, including posters, drawings, paintings, musical arrangements, and compositions.  Artists of all types shared gallery and theater space and were encouraged to collaborate.  The Centro became the center for a multitude of San José Chicano artists presenting everything from visual arts exhibits to city-wide cultural events, and were influential in the development of San José City Arts and Events Programs. | Jesús Manuel Mena Garza, Serigraphy Studio, Garza Personal Collection, From 1970-1975 Series.

In 1969 the Mexican American Liberation Art Front (MALAF), a Chicano artists’ collective in the Fruitvale District of Oakland, was one of the first Chicano art collectives in the United States. Founded by Chicano artists Malaquias Montoya, Manuel Hernandez, Rene Yanez, and art professor Esteban Villa, it was one of the main poster producers for various protest events and movements in the 1960s and  soon created a circle of artists and activists interested in political and cultural work. | In I970 the Royal Chicano Air Force (RCAF) was founded as the Rebel Chicano Arts Front | at Sacramento State. This was an artist’s collective run by Jose Montoya, Esteban Villa, and Richard Favela to support the arts in the Chicano community and to educate young people in arts, history, and culture. Their mission also included promoting political awareness, and support for César Chávez and the United Farm Workers.  In 1972, the RCAF created the Centro De Artistas Chicanos, a hub for community programs including La Nueva Raza Bookstore and Galeria Posada, RCAF Danzantes, RCAF Graphics and Design Center, and the Barrio Art Program for children.  Many of the artists involved were educators, writers, poets, and musicians who contributed Chicano civil rights activism and to the promotion of Chicano art history, literature, and culture. As artists and activists, the silkscreen posters they created were highly political, expressing community concerns and viewed as instruments of social change. | The Chicano Mural Movement | The Chicano Mural Movement began in the 1960s when murals appeared extensively in the Southwest as part of the national Chicano Movement.  While famous Mexican muralists such as Diego Rivera had created monumental public art, Chicano muralists used their work to increase the visibility of the Mexican American experience and to advance the Chicano Civil Rights Movement. Murals were painted on buildings, schools, churches, and other public areas in Mexican American barrios, or neighborhoods. Murals continued in their traditional role as a visual narrative, while recording significant social and political events. Traditional cultural icons and symbols were infused with new meaning when they depicted contemporary struggles.  In the 1960s and 1970s, many artists were Vietnam veterans and their murals incorporated images of war and loss, along with Mexican revolutionary figures, the struggles of immigrants, and social justice issues relevant to Mexican and Latino-Americans. | Although women artists were still in the minority as muralists, the Mujeres Muralistas (MM) in San Francisco was an all-women art collective founded in the 1970s by Patricia Rodriguez, Graciela Carillo, Consuela Mendez, and Irene Perez. Their intention was to celebrate the culture and contributions of Mexican American and Latina women and to recognize the talent of Latina artists. Their images celebrated Latina women artists and historical figures as well as everyday women in the community in their various roles as wives, mothers, and workers. Some in the Mexican community questioned their ability to handle the physically strenuous work, while others questioned their focus on the lives of women and images of beauty. Public acceptance of their art influenced a shift from the stark images of war and loss typically produced by male muralists to a broader range of themes and color palettes. The Women’s Movement had often overlooked the perspectives of non-Anglo American women, and The Mujeres Muralistas’ art recognized Latina women’s experiences as integral to representations of Mexican American culture and socio-political issues. | Title : Nuestro Mural de la Raza | Photographer: Jose Meza and his wife Juanita Velasquez | Date: 1980s | Collection: Silicon Valley De-Bug | Owning Institution: José Meza | Source: Jose Meza | Additional Online Information | ¡Printing the Revolution!

Formed in the 1970s, they performed with various South Bay Teatro Chicano groups — including El Teatro Campesino — and were on stage at the Chicano Moratorium on August 29, 1970, when police violence broke up a peaceful demonstration. Their 1977 album, Música de Nuestra América, incorporated Latin American protest music influences on Chicana/o Movement musical style. | Chicano Literary Movement | The Chicano community was rediscovering the power of literature to communicate philosophies and experiences and inspire change. The poem “I am Joaquin,” | written | in 1967 by Chicano Nationalist leader Corky Gonzalez, was significant as an anthem for the Chicano Civil Rights Movement and was soon adapted into a short film directed by Luís Váldez. The poem reflects on the complicated relationship of Chicanos to America, with a heritage that incorporates Spanish, Aztec, American Indian, and European American sources. While fighting for integrated schools and equal access to education, the Chicano Civil Rights Movement strongly supported bilingual education, which was illegal in many states at the time. | A long history of colonization had created a rich oral tradition of storytelling, plays, and narrative songs called | corridos. | Indigenous oral traditions provided a way to express discontent with racial discrimination and envision an alternative future.  A powerful voice among Chicana writers is poet and publisher Lorna Dee Cervantes. Born in San Francisco and raised in downtown San José, | s | he started writing poetry as a teenager and was determined that her words would be accessible to readers like herself. In 1976, Cervantes founded MANGO Publications, the first to publish many famous Chicano writers, including Sandra Cisneros, Jimmy Santiago Baca, and Alberto Rios. | Numerous Chicano newspapers, activist organization newsletters, and scholarly and arts publications arose during this period.  These included papers such as | El Manchete, Bronce and La Palabra, | and | Que Tal | , a student newspaper. While some were short lived, they documented the concerns of diverse ethnic Mexican communities and interpreted the goals of the Chicano Civil Rights Movement for their audiences.  The Chicano Press Association, established in 1969, had twenty two members at its height, mostly in California. Quinto Sol of Berkeley, the first fully independent publishing house, was founded in 1967 at UC Berkeley by Octavio I. Romano. They published the interdisciplinary | El Grito: A Journal of Contemporary Mexican-American Thought, | the first national academic and literary journal ever published in the United States. | Title : Teatro De La Gente | Photographer: Jesus Manuel Mena Garza | Date: 1970-1975 | Collection: JMM Garza Photo | Owning Institution: | Source: | Additional Online Information | The Music of Flor del Pueblo | Chicano Literature: The Theme Of Cultural Resistance | Chicano Poetry - Research Guides at Washington University in St. Louis | The California Lowriders: A Merging of Chicano Civil Rights and Culture | Cruising originally began in downtown San José until police diverted riders into the unincorporated Eastside, particularly near the intersection of Story and King Roads.  According to Jesus Flores, a car club historian, low-riding crowds grew on the Eastside. Similarly, in Los Angeles low-riders had been pushed off of Whittier Boulevard by new restrictions. Many ethnic Mexican Angelenos faced similar obstacles to those in Santa Clara County. Lowriders cruised up to Eastside San José in numbers that resulted in the creation of “No Cruising” zones. Low riding culture went underground until the City of San José lifted the City’s low-riding restriction in 2022. According to Smithsonian curator Steve Velasquez, during the Chicano Movement in the 1960s and 1970s, car clubs took on a politically empowered perspective, inviting family involvement and undertaking community events such as fundraising for the United Farm Workers labor union and hosting health initiatives. The car-culture aspect of low-riding was 10 percent, while the social aspect was 90 percent. | Mexican veterans had utilized mechanical skills learned in the military to modify older models and lowered the rears of the cars with weights in order to stylishly cruise the roads. So it was no surprise when San José introduced the use of hydraulics in the low-riding scene. In 1977, San José State University students Larry Gonzalez, Sonny Madrid, and David Nunez pooled their money and published the first | Low Rider Magazine | in a small store front on Willow Street in San José. Just as the Chicano Movement utilized mythical Aztec artistic designs reminiscent of Diego Rivera murals, so did low-rider car artists. Velasquez noted that car artistic expression became a tool of resistance, calling the cars “mobile canvases.” As noted in Smithsonian Magazine, low-riding became “the nexus between art and activism. | Title : 2nd National Lowrider Car SHow & Car Hop Championship Advertisement | Photographer: | Date: 1979/06 | Collection: History San José Ephemera Collection | Owning Institution: History San Jose | Source: | Scholar Talk | Additional Online Information | East Side Revelations - Lowriding | San José Public Library | California Low Riders, San José, 1978 | “San José’s History of Lowriding” | Low Riders in the Barrio 1979 | The Vibrant History of Lowrider Car Culture in L.A. | Travel | Smithsonian Magazine | Cruising for Community: Youth Culture and Politics in Los Angeles, 1910-1970. | Ph.D. Dissertation. Ides, Matthew Allan. 2009."}

Over the next hundred years, until the 1960s, Anglo growers shifted to more profitable irrigated specialty orchard crops–cherries, pears, plums, and peaches. By 1930 growers devoted 65% of Santa Clara County land to fruit trees, expanding from only ten acres in 1890. According to historian Jacklyn Greenberg, prune trees dominated fruit production in Santa Clara County, which became the nation’s largest exporter of prunes between 1920 and 1940. Most of the specialty orchard and row (tomato and pea) crop farms were smaller than the large-scale, agribusiness farms of Salinas and the San Joaquín Valley. By 1915, local boosters dubbed Santa Clara “The Valley of the Heart’s Delight.” | Following early experimentation, the canning industry, established in 1872, accelerated the distribution of fruit crops to markets made accessible by railroads. The value of these crops grew rapidly with the construction in 1864 of the first commercial rail line to Santa Clara County, the San Francisco-San Jose Railway, which was sold to Southern Pacific in 1887. | In the early 20th century (1910s to 1960s), Santa Clara County became the nation’s capital for fruit or specialty crop production and processing (canning). | With the shift to specialty irrigated crops, a large labor force was necessary for harvesting and drying. During the dry-farm years of wheat production in the 1850s-1860s, Anglo-American men carrying their belongings on their back migrated throughout California in search of harvest work. With the shift to specialty orchard crops in Santa Clara County in the 1870s, an even larger labor force was needed for planting, irrigating, weeding, and harvesting. Many early farmworkers in specialty crops were Mexican | Californio | men and families who had lost their land and become wage laborers. Workers also included Chinese immigrant men and ethnically white immigrant families, such as Portuguese, Spanish, and Italians. By the 1890s Japanese men entered the specialty crop labor force and were joined in the 1910s by Japanese women and families. The availability of low-cost migrant farm labor helped expand fruit ranching in Santa Clara County. | 1  of | 13 | Title: Blooming Orchard Trees Vista, Santa Clara County | Date: 1935 | Catalog No: 1997-300-1009 | Collection: History San José Photographic Collection | Source: Calisphere | Fruit Drying and Packinghouses | Orchard crops that ripened at the same time caused a problem for orchard ranchers as fruit flooded the local market and decreased profits.

Due to the nature of their low-paid seasonal jobs, most ethnic Mexican migrants were unable to join permanent | colonia | settlements throughout the county. On the road, they might stay a week or a month working a crop in one location until the harvest ended and then moving onto the next. | One route began in the lower part of California around San Diego or Imperial Valley, starting in February with row crops such as cantaloupe, tomatoes, or garlic. From there, migrants headed up to the Los Angeles area (primarily in the citrus orchards); then over the Tehachapi Mountains to the San Joaquin Valley working in row crops; then up through Bakersfield, Visalia, Fresno, Modesto and over Pacheco Pass to Hollister and Gilroy; then north to Santa Clara County; and finally back south again. | A second route extended north from the Los Angeles citrus area up the Central Coast through Santa Barbara, Santa Maria and Nipomo, and the Salinas Valley working row crops. The route continued to Santa Clara County in June for orchard or row crops, then over to the Fresno area in August for grapes or other row crops, and then returning south to the Los Angeles area. | Flood conditions in the Rio Grande Valley pushed a new group of Mexicans, particularly from Del Rio, Texas, onto the migrant path to Santa Clara County after WWII.

By the late 1920s and 1930s, migrant families acquired used cars and brought their own tents, mattresses, and cooking equipment on the road. Migrating in a car with a family of 12 or more was a challenge! | During fruit season, workers found that most growers offered no housing or sanitary facilities, so they camped under bridges or in tents in the open fields or built temporary shelters with fruit boxes. Innovative families used wooden crates to create tables, chairs, cabinets, or bed platforms. Not until WWII did ethnic Mexicans come to settle more permanently in the segregated | colonias | of San José or Santa Clara County, called by Anglos “Mexicantown” or “Jimtown” in reference to Jim Crow laws of the South. | 9  of | 13 | Title: Establishment of Rural Rehabilitation Camps for Migrants in California.

Most of the Mexicans had their own little tents that they brought along with them, living in their car. All the tents hanging off the cars, just like you see in THE GRAPES OF WRATH. They really had big cars because they really needed them—even though they were more expensive to keep up. There was very little eviction because they didn’t live in any place. They had their own things with them, just like a snail would; you carry your own shells with you. They could take the tents off the land, when people said you have to get off the land. Because if you came to pick peas, you generally camped on the land that the peas were on. | Elizabeth Nicholas (1930s CAWIU Santa Clara Valley cannery union organizer) Interview by Margo McBane, 1970s, MountainView, CA. | We went to Santa Maria, and my dad bought a tent and he made a great big bed. The whole family slept on that one big bed…. [We had our own stove] and my mother was good at [setting up the tent]. She would get the boxes that they used to pick tomatoes and prunes and she would just stack ‘em and make shelving. And she’d cook outside. | Sid Duran Interview by Margo McBane, Oct. 3, 2011, San José Chapter GI Forum Headquarters | We were 13 kids. And we used to go pick apricots in Saratoga. There’s a street, it’s called Cox | Avenue. | And we picked prunes for Ed Cox. So when he brought us, he would just tell us, “Okay, | you can camp in that bare area there”. He had one outhouse and one faucet sticking up from the | ground, and everybody got water from that one faucet. And some people brought tents. [My | mom and my granddad] had a tent, and so we used it. At that time, on the beds there were no | box springs and mattresses like we have now. They were the bare springs, and the mattresses | were the cotton… that you would roll up. So, we would take our beds from the home and we | would roll them up and tie it with a piece of rope. Tie each end and throw them up in the truck, | four of those or as many as we needed.  We didn’t bring food because when we got here we | would ask Ed Cox to advance us  some money so we could go to the grocery store and buy food. | And so my mother would pack  most of the stuff in about three old tin bathtubs that had holes in | Them…that are small at the bottom, wide at the top…  [When we got to the campsite] First of | all, we would get some apricot [and prune] trays and stand them up and tie them with wire | and… make two rooms.  [Then we would take more trays] and make a platform upside down | and unroll our mattress on that. And my mom and dad slept on one side,... [And the 13 of] us on | the other side. My dad would make a mound of dirt and maybe two feet wide and eight inches | high.  He would [take one of the three old tin tubs] turn it upside down on that mound of dirt | just to elevate it a Little bit.  He would cut a hole on the side of the tub and that was my | mother’s stove….  When we bought food, we always bought  a hundred pound sack of flour and | a hundred pound sack of beans…we couldn’t go to a store and get milk, my mother always | bought canned milk in boxes…  My mother would then make tortillas, probably at least twice a | day from scratch.  She would stand up a hundred-pound sack of flour and open it up.  Then she | would get a pan, maybe six or eight inches deep… She would make the dough by hand. She | knew exactly how much water to put in it and a little salt and baking powder.  She had done it | millions of times.  In five minutes she would have enough dough to make three or four dozen | tortillas by hand.  She would roll them out by hand and cook them on top of the bottom of that | tin top. And she would make potatoes and eggs. She used to cook potatoes in a big frying pan | and she would crack a half dozen eggs. That’s how we ate eggs and potatoes. | Fernando Chavez | Interview by Margo McBane and Peggy Chavez, Feb. 6, 2008, Cupertino, CA. | 10  of | 13 | Title:  1930s Mexican and Dustbowl Farmworker Family Living | Date: 1930s | Creator:  (name of Photographer) Dorothea Lange | Reproduction No. (if applicable): 8b2700 | Repository: Library of Congress | Collection:  Farm Security Administration | Orchard vs. Row Crop/Field Work | During the 1920s and 1930s, Mexicans performed 80% of the harvest work in Santa Clara County. Racially and ethnically segregated workplaces were the norm in orchard and row crops, with each group working either a different crop or at a different skill level and getting paid different amounts. Anglo male farmworkers filled the skilled year-round work of pruning and irrigating, while Mexican immigrant workers were forced into seasonal harvest jobs. Mexican workers labored for at least ten hours a day, seven days a week during harvest season and were paid on a piece-work rather than hourly basis. | With the introduction of specialty crops in the late 1800s, only male workers were hired; however, employers soon found they could attract and retain workers if they employed men with families. Between 1920-1940 first-generation Mexican immigrant men and children, who began | work at five or six years of age, | often worked as a group, with only the father paid for his entire family’s labor. Mexican immigrant mothers stayed at home to care for their babies and campsites; women did not enter cannery work in Santa Clara Valley until World War II. | Child labor laws (covering minors under age 15) were not created until 1938 when Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which was not enforced until after WWII. The federal Fair Employment Practices Committee, established by the Roosevelt administration in 1941, found that more than one-third of all complaints came from Mexican agricultural workers. | 11  of | 13 | Title:  Villareal Family Picking Prunes on Kimball Ranch | Date: 1937 | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archives, Herminia and Leandro Villareal Family Collection | Source:  San José State University Special Collections | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Orchard vs. Field/Row Crop Work Quotes | My mom was working at the camp. She had to keep track of the kids. There were probably a half dozen little kids there. [The rest of the kids worked] with my dad.  If you can carry a bucket, and you can pick a prune, you were old enough. In the 1940s, there were no regulations. If you wanted to bring your five-year-old to pick prunes, you could take him. Nobody said anything. [We would start at] seven o’clock in the morning. My mother used to make tacos and send them to us ‘cuz we weren’t too far from the camp. [We’d] work until five o’clock at night. In Southern California [citrus], they would shake the trees and [but in Santa Clara County  you would pick prunes off the ground… You would put them in a bucket, then you fill the boxes.  They [the prunes] would fall and get pieces of dirt in them and get a little damaged | . | So you had to be on your knees, or one knee, whichever way you could.  If you had a child, he’d have a little bucket.  The full buckets probably weighed thirty pounds.  Some mothers picked prunes, whole families, men, women, and children.  Everybody picks prunes | . | Here in San José, you would pick apricots off the tree.  If it falls off you don’t pick it because everything here went to the canneries.  Here in San José, when you picked apricots, you had to carry your own ladder, [wooden ladder]. They didn’t have aluminum ladders like they do now. | Fernando Chavez Interview by Dr. Margo McBane, Ph.D. and Peggy Wallace, Feb. 6, 2008, Cupertino, CA. | In the summers, we went to the San Joaquin Valley from San José to work.  I started at 6-7 years old picking cotton. Well, you had to get up at four in the morning ‘cause it’s too damn hot in the [San Joaquin] Valley. I mean by noon you’re already at 105, 110. So we’d get up early… So my mom would have her sack, and I’d have mine, and my younger brother Jim, would be with my mom’s sack, we’d pull him, and my other brother would be with me. He was more sickly than my other brother. He had asthma, he had eczema, and things of that nature.  So we used to drag him ‘cause it was dark when we were out there picking.  The only thing…they’re out picking cotton and you get the little things stuck in your fingernails and stuff. We tried to wear gloves, but it was hard because you couldn’t feel the cotton to pick. When we would go to Wasco, we would stay with my grandfather. He only had a one bedroom house, and so it was a house full of people [laughing].  Besides my grandparents, there were two other families. My aunt Alice and her kids, she had six, and then my brothers and I and my mom. We would take mattress outside and sleep out in the front yard. It was so hot, and there was no air conditioning. Their big thing was to get what they called “swamp coolers”. You used water to cool off. There was no air conditioner, that was the air conditioner in those days. I remember going and dumping all the cotton and weighing it, they weighed it before they dumped it.  My mother would take the money we made. And I graduated from cotton to picking grapes in Del Rey with an uncle of mine. Coming back to San José, it was always prunes, mostly prunes, apricots, and then pears. It’s hot [laughs] and, well, the first thing you learn as a farmworker, you ask in terms of pay. Okay, how are you going to pay me? By the bucket, the box? What got me out of the farmwork was, I was probably about twelve, thirteen years old, we went, my mom and I, we had an aunt and uncle that were across from the old IBM building, across from where my grandfather had his ranch. My aunt and uncle were foremen on a ranch, and my parents left us there for the summer. So, when the owner came, I was asking, ‘How much are you paying us? Well how much would I get for picking a ton of prunes?” He looked at me [surprised].  “Yeah, you’re gonna pick a ton of prunes…” He gave me some number, and I said “Oh, okay.” Well I picked a ton of prunes. But when he put that money in my hands, I’m looking at it going, “Wait a minute. A ton of prunes. No, this doesn’t equate.” It was like seven dollars or something like that. But that’s what it was like… When you’re picking prunes, or you’re picking anything, you couldn’t wait to get closer to the road. Wherever you were working, to get closer, to see what people were driving. That there were people driving nice cars, or doing something you couldn’t do. I couldn’t be out there going on a luxury drive or whatever. But then you’d come back away from the road, because you’re working in rows, particularly with fruit or vegetables. | Richard Vasquez Interviewed by Dr. Margo McBane, Ph.D. and Margarita Garcia Villa, Dec. 21, 2016, Watsonville, CA | 12  of | 13 | Title:  Chavez Family Picking Prunes in Saratoga, CA | Date: 1930s | Creator:  Chavez Family | Collection: Fernando Chavez Family Collection (contributed to Before Silicon Valley, AAACNA, SJSU Library) | Bracero Farm Work and Housing | World War II became known as California’s second gold rush. Growers turned to the federal government to help fill the labor gap created by military enlistment and government military contracts, which were not open to Mexican workers. The 1942 Emergency Farm Labor Agreement signed by Mexico and the U.S. sent thousands of | braceros | (men who work with their arms) across the border to fill lower-paid, seasonal agricultural jobs. The war-time emergency program lasted until 1964 and deterred any successful agricultural unionizing efforts undertaken by Mexican farmworkers during WWII and after. | By July 1945 more than 58,000 | braceros | were working in agriculture (cannery and farm work), with almost 62,000 on railroad crews. At the peak harvest season of August 1954, there were 1,000 | braceros | employed in Santa Clara County. According to the transnational agreement, | bracero | workers were not to undercut local domestic labor and were to be provided with adequate housing. It was up to the Mexican consulate to inspect | bracero | living and working conditions. In California, with Mexican consular offices only in Los Angeles and San Francisco, it was difficult to monitor the program and enforce the terms of the agreement. | 13  of | 13 | Title: Stockton (vicinity), California.

Over the next hundred years, until the 1960s, Anglo growers shifted to more profitable irrigated specialty orchard crops–cherries, pears, plums, and peaches. By 1930 growers devoted 65% of Santa Clara County land to fruit trees, expanding from only ten acres in 1890. According to historian Jacklyn Greenberg, prune trees dominated fruit production in Santa Clara County, which became the nation’s largest exporter of prunes between 1920 and 1940. Most of the specialty orchard and row (tomato and pea) crop farms were smaller than the large-scale, agribusiness farms of Salinas and the San Joaquín Valley. By 1915, local boosters dubbed Santa Clara “The Valley of the Heart’s Delight.” | Following early experimentation, the canning industry, established in 1872, accelerated the distribution of fruit crops to markets made accessible by railroads. The value of these crops grew rapidly with the construction in 1864 of the first commercial rail line to Santa Clara County, the San Francisco-San Jose Railway, which was sold to Southern Pacific in 1887. | In the early 20th century (1910s to 1960s), Santa Clara County became the nation’s capital for fruit or specialty crop production and processing (canning). | With the shift to specialty irrigated crops, a large labor force was necessary for harvesting and drying. During the dry-farm years of wheat production in the 1850s-1860s, Anglo-American men carrying their belongings on their back migrated throughout California in search of harvest work. With the shift to specialty orchard crops in Santa Clara County in the 1870s, an even larger labor force was needed for planting, irrigating, weeding, and harvesting. Many early farmworkers in specialty crops were Mexican | Californio | men and families who had lost their land and become wage laborers. Workers also included Chinese immigrant men and ethnically white immigrant families, such as Portuguese, Spanish, and Italians. By the 1890s Japanese men entered the specialty crop labor force and were joined in the 1910s by Japanese women and families. The availability of low-cost migrant farm labor helped expand fruit ranching in Santa Clara County. | Title: Blooming Orchard Trees Vista, Santa Clara County | Date: 1935 | Catalog No: 1997-300-1009 | Collection: History San José Photographic Collection | Source: Calisphere | Fruit Drying and Packinghouses | Orchard crops that ripened at the same time caused a problem for orchard ranchers as fruit flooded the local market and decreased profits.

Due to the nature of their low-paid seasonal jobs, most ethnic Mexican migrants were unable to join permanent | colonia | settlements throughout the county. On the road, they might stay a week or a month working a crop in one location until the harvest ended and then moving onto the next. | One route began in the lower part of California around San Diego or Imperial Valley, starting in February with row crops such as cantaloupe, tomatoes, or garlic. From there, migrants headed up to the Los Angeles area (primarily in the citrus orchards); then over the Tehachapi Mountains to the San Joaquin Valley working in row crops; then up through Bakersfield, Visalia, Fresno, Modesto and over Pacheco Pass to Hollister and Gilroy; then north to Santa Clara County; and finally back south again. | A second route extended north from the Los Angeles citrus area up the Central Coast through Santa Barbara, Santa Maria and Nipomo, and the Salinas Valley working row crops. The route continued to Santa Clara County in June for orchard or row crops, then over to the Fresno area in August for grapes or other row crops, and then returning south to the Los Angeles area. | Flood conditions in the Rio Grande Valley pushed a new group of Mexicans, particularly from Del Rio, Texas, onto the migrant path to Santa Clara County after WWII.

My father, and my mother’s father, my grandfather, worked on the railroad, the Union Pacific Railroad. And for that reason, I… have over 2,000 relatives in 46 states, the majority is in California, Texas, because of the railroad. They came prior to the Revolution, around 1910. That’s the reason my mother was born in Midland, Texas, because of the railroad. Midland is like the hub of the Union Pacific.

(We use the term Santa Clara County here instead of Santa Clara Valley so as to clarify which region we are referring to.) | In Ventura County citrus workers harvested the lemon crop during the winter months and were then available for other crops during the more traditional summer harvest season. Historian Margo McBane found that growers from the north sent trucks down to Ventura County (around the Santa Paula region) to pick up citrus worker families to live and work in Santa Clara County for the summer fruit harvest. After the Great Citrus Strike of 1941 in Ventura County, many of these workers, who had been evicted from company housing during the strike, as well as family and friends from the Santa Paula region, chose to come to work permanently in Santa Clara County. | Title: Workers Loading Boxes Marked \"Limoneira Company\" with Oranges, ca.1920 | Date: circa 1920 | Collection: California Historical Society Collection, 1860-1960 | Owning Institution: California Historical Society | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/ba27c17973616f0c29a1cdb060a67dfd/ | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | Puentes Brothers Mexican Family History San Jose, CA  2/24/2019 | Racial Segregation Practices at the Limoneira Company and Santa Paula, 1893–1919 | Ventura County 1941 Great Citrus Strike Refugees Quotes | I lived in Santa Paula until I was 18.  Then in February of 1943, I was drafted into the Army.  My family was still living in Santa Paula. In [1941] the [Limoneira Company citrus] strike was lost, and my dad did not want to go back to picking lemons.  They moved to San José…  We knew San José best because we used to come and pick prunes [and apricots] here every year.  The ranchers in San José would go and pick you up [in Santa Paula] because you couldn’t pack 13 kids and mom and dad in a car to come from Santa Paula…to San José with all your bedding and dishes and all the stuff you need because you were camping. The ranchers wanted to guarantee that they had enough workers to help pick their crops, so they would bring two extra families, three families, five families, six families. Whatever they needed.  And then, after the apricots, then they would take you back.  [In Santa Paula] we used to live in the Limoneira [Company] housing…   In July, that is apricot season [in San Jose],.... In August, we used to pick prunes and then… we used to go back [to Santa Paula] and pick walnuts [and lemons].  So we knew there was a lot of work [in San José], you know, ranch work… irrigating, pruning, picking the crops and all that kind of stuff.  [After WWII]  [in San José] they worked year-round… -- cherries, pears… And then in the winter time you’d spray trees and prune the trees. There was always work. In San José, they had a lot of farm labor offices.  All you had to do was call them up. The ranchers would call the farm labor office, and you would tell them, “I need three men, four men, to irrigate or prune or whatever, to pick or whatever”.  Workers just call there and say, “I am looking for work.”  And you didn’t have to go there. You could call up, and they would send you.  That’s what my mother did. They knew her already.  She’d call and say, “I have two men that want…work”. Then she’d tell my father and my brothers, where they needed help. And they’d just go there, and they had a job. [After WWII] I decided that I wanted to learn a trade, and, and the government was paying for it [through the GI Bill].  They would pay for you to go to school and learn something.  That was part of the benefits you would get in the Army. And so I decided that I couldn’t go to college for four years because I already had two kids, and I worked to support them. I wanted something…that was better than working in ranches, and so, I picked barbering. And that’s what I have done for since 1950, 57 years | .

Early Mexican rail crews in Santa Clara County were housed in tents and work camps, bunkhouses, or in rooms near railyards. As adjacent communities and industries grew, boxcar housing in the railyards became the nucleus of the first Mexican worker neighborhoods. When they turned to migrant farm work, many Mexicans would camp on growers’ land. By the late 1920s and 1930s, migrant families acquired used cars and brought their own tents, mattresses, and cooking equipment on the road. Migrating in a car with a family of 12 or more was a challenge! | During fruit season, workers found that most growers offered no housing or sanitary facilities, so they camped under bridges or in tents in the open fields or built temporary shelters with fruit boxes. Innovative families used wooden crates to create tables, chairs, cabinets, or bed platforms. Not until WWII did ethnic Mexicans come to settle more permanently in the segregated | colonias | of San José or Santa Clara County, called by Anglos “Mexicantown” or “Jimtown” in reference to Jim Crow laws of the South. | Title: Establishment of Rural Rehabilitation Camps for Migrants in California.

Most of the Mexicans had their own little tents that they brought along with them, living in their car. All the tents hanging off the cars, just like you see in THE GRAPES OF WRATH. They really had big cars because they really needed them—even though they were more expensive to keep up. There was very little eviction because they didn’t live in any place. They had their own things with them, just like a snail would; you carry your own shells with you. They could take the tents off the land, when people said you have to get off the land. Because if you came to pick peas, you generally camped on the land that the peas were on. | Elizabeth Nicholas (1930s CAWIU Santa Clara Valley cannery union organizer) Interview by Margo McBane, 1970s, MountainView, CA. | We went to Santa Maria, and my dad bought a tent and he made a great big bed. The whole family slept on that one big bed…. [We had our own stove] and my mother was good at [setting up the tent]. She would get the boxes that they used to pick tomatoes and prunes and she would just stack ‘em and make shelving. And she’d cook outside. | Sid Duran Interview by Margo McBane, Oct. 3, 2011, San José Chapter GI Forum Headquarters | We were 13 kids. And we used to go pick apricots in Saratoga. There’s a street, it’s called Cox | Avenue. | And we picked prunes for Ed Cox. So when he brought us, he would just tell us, “Okay, | you can camp in that bare area there”. He had one outhouse and one faucet sticking up from the | ground, and everybody got water from that one faucet. And some people brought tents. [My | mom and my granddad] had a tent, and so we used it. At that time, on the beds there were no | box springs and mattresses like we have now. They were the bare springs, and the mattresses | were the cotton… that you would roll up. So, we would take our beds from the home and we | would roll them up and tie it with a piece of rope. Tie each end and throw them up in the truck, | four of those or as many as we needed.  We didn’t bring food because when we got here we | would ask Ed Cox to advance us  some money so we could go to the grocery store and buy food. | And so my mother would pack  most of the stuff in about three old tin bathtubs that had holes in | Them…that are small at the bottom, wide at the top…  [When we got to the campsite] First of | all, we would get some apricot [and prune] trays and stand them up and tie them with wire | and… make two rooms.  [Then we would take more trays] and make a platform upside down | and unroll our mattress on that. And my mom and dad slept on one side,... [And the 13 of] us on | the other side. My dad would make a mound of dirt and maybe two feet wide and eight inches | high.  He would [take one of the three old tin tubs] turn it upside down on that mound of dirt | just to elevate it a Little bit.  He would cut a hole on the side of the tub and that was my | mother’s stove….  When we bought food, we always bought  a hundred pound sack of flour and | a hundred pound sack of beans…we couldn’t go to a store and get milk, my mother always | bought canned milk in boxes…  My mother would then make tortillas, probably at least twice a | day from scratch.  She would stand up a hundred-pound sack of flour and open it up.  Then she | would get a pan, maybe six or eight inches deep… She would make the dough by hand. She | knew exactly how much water to put in it and a little salt and baking powder.  She had done it | millions of times.  In five minutes she would have enough dough to make three or four dozen | tortillas by hand.  She would roll them out by hand and cook them on top of the bottom of that | tin top.

Racially and ethnically segregated workplaces were the norm in orchard and row crops, with each group working either a different crop or at a different skill level and getting paid different amounts. Anglo male farmworkers filled the skilled year-round work of pruning and irrigating, while Mexican immigrant workers were forced into seasonal harvest jobs. Mexican workers labored for at least ten hours a day, seven days a week during harvest season and were paid on a piece-work rather than hourly basis. | With the introduction of specialty crops in the late 1800s, only male workers were hired; however, employers soon found they could attract and retain workers if they employed men with families. Between 1920-1940 first-generation Mexican immigrant men and children, who began | work at five or six years of age, | often worked as a group, with only the father paid for his entire family’s labor. Mexican immigrant mothers stayed at home to care for their babies and campsites; women did not enter cannery work in Santa Clara Valley until World War II. | Child labor laws (covering minors under age 15) were not created until 1938 when Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which was not enforced until after WWII. The federal Fair Employment Practices Committee, established by the Roosevelt administration in 1941, found that more than one-third of all complaints came from Mexican agricultural workers. | Title:  Villareal Family Picking Prunes on Kimball Ranch | Date: 1937 | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archives, Herminia and Leandro Villareal Family Collection | Source:  San José State University Special Collections | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Orchard vs. Field/Row Crop Work Quotes | My mom was working at the camp. She had to keep track of the kids. There were probably a half dozen little kids there. [The rest of the kids worked] with my dad.  If you can carry a bucket, and you can pick a prune, you were old enough. In the 1940s, there were no regulations. If you wanted to bring your five-year-old to pick prunes, you could take him. Nobody said anything. [We would start at] seven o’clock in the morning. My mother used to make tacos and send them to us ‘cuz we weren’t too far from the camp. [We’d] work until five o’clock at night. In Southern California [citrus], they would shake the trees and [but in Santa Clara County  you would pick prunes off the ground… You would put them in a bucket, then you fill the boxes.  They [the prunes] would fall and get pieces of dirt in them and get a little damaged | . | So you had to be on your knees, or one knee, whichever way you could.  If you had a child, he’d have a little bucket.  The full buckets probably weighed thirty pounds.  Some mothers picked prunes, whole families, men, women, and children.  Everybody picks prunes | . | Here in San José, you would pick apricots off the tree.  If it falls off you don’t pick it because everything here went to the canneries.  Here in San José, when you picked apricots, you had to carry your own ladder, [wooden ladder]. They didn’t have aluminum ladders like they do now. | Fernando Chavez Interview by Dr. Margo McBane, Ph.D. and Peggy Wallace, Feb. 6, 2008, Cupertino, CA. | In the summers, we went to the San Joaquin Valley from San José to work.  I started at 6-7 years old picking cotton. Well, you had to get up at four in the morning ‘cause it’s too damn hot in the [San Joaquin] Valley. I mean by noon you’re already at 105, 110. So we’d get up early… So my mom would have her sack, and I’d have mine, and my younger brother Jim, would be with my mom’s sack, we’d pull him, and my other brother would be with me. He was more sickly than my other brother. He had asthma, he had eczema, and things of that nature.  So we used to drag him ‘cause it was dark when we were out there picking.  The only thing…they’re out picking cotton and you get the little things stuck in your fingernails and stuff. We tried to wear gloves, but it was hard because you couldn’t feel the cotton to pick. When we would go to Wasco, we would stay with my grandfather. He only had a one bedroom house, and so it was a house full of people [laughing].  Besides my grandparents, there were two other families. My aunt Alice and her kids, she had six, and then my brothers and I and my mom. We would take mattress outside and sleep out in the front yard. It was so hot, and there was no air conditioning. Their big thing was to get what they called “swamp coolers”. You used water to cool off. There was no air conditioner, that was the air conditioner in those days. I remember going and dumping all the cotton and weighing it, they weighed it before they dumped it.  My mother would take the money we made. And I graduated from cotton to picking grapes in Del Rey with an uncle of mine. Coming back to San José, it was always prunes, mostly prunes, apricots, and then pears. It’s hot [laughs] and, well, the first thing you learn as a farmworker, you ask in terms of pay. Okay, how are you going to pay me? By the bucket, the box? What got me out of the farmwork was, I was probably about twelve, thirteen years old, we went, my mom and I, we had an aunt and uncle that were across from the old IBM building, across from where my grandfather had his ranch. My aunt and uncle were foremen on a ranch, and my parents left us there for the summer. So, when the owner came, I was asking, ‘How much are you paying us? Well how much would I get for picking a ton of prunes?” He looked at me [surprised].  “Yeah, you’re gonna pick a ton of prunes…” He gave me some number, and I said “Oh, okay.” Well I picked a ton of prunes. But when he put that money in my hands, I’m looking at it going, “Wait a minute. A ton of prunes. No, this doesn’t equate.” It was like seven dollars or something like that. But that’s what it was like… When you’re picking prunes, or you’re picking anything, you couldn’t wait to get closer to the road. Wherever you were working, to get closer, to see what people were driving. That there were people driving nice cars, or doing something you couldn’t do. I couldn’t be out there going on a luxury drive or whatever. But then you’d come back away from the road, because you’re working in rows, particularly with fruit or vegetables. | Richard Vasquez Interviewed by Dr. Margo McBane, Ph.D. and Margarita Garcia Villa, Dec. 21, 2016, Watsonville, CA | Title:  Chavez Family Picking Prunes in Saratoga, CA | Date: 1930s | Creator:  Chavez Family | Collection: Fernando Chavez Family Collection (contributed to Before Silicon Valley, AAACNA, SJSU Library) | Bracero Farm Work and Housing | World War II became known as California’s second gold rush. Growers turned to the federal government to help fill the labor gap created by military enlistment and government military contracts, which were not open to Mexican workers. The 1942 Emergency Farm Labor Agreement signed by Mexico and the U.S. sent thousands of | braceros | (men who work with their arms) across the border to fill lower-paid, seasonal agricultural jobs. The war-time emergency program lasted until 1964 and deterred any successful agricultural unionizing efforts undertaken by Mexican farmworkers during WWII and after. | By July 1945 more than 58,000 | braceros | were working in agriculture (cannery and farm work), with almost 62,000 on railroad crews. At the peak harvest season of August 1954, there were 1,000 | braceros | employed in Santa Clara County. According to the transnational agreement, | bracero | workers were not to undercut local domestic labor and were to be provided with adequate housing. It was up to the Mexican consulate to inspect | bracero | living and working conditions. In California, with Mexican consular offices only in Los Angeles and San Francisco, it was difficult to monitor the program and enforce the terms of the agreement. | Title: Stockton (vicinity), California.

During this time, Santa Clara County saw some of the most significant agricultural strikes in the U.S., many involving Mexican workers. Before WWII, most Mexicans worked on farms in the fruit and nut orchards or tomato and pea field/row crops. The Depression of the 1930s saw a deterioration in working conditions and a dramatic decrease in pay for orchard and field workers, who were paid by piece work rather than hourly wages. Historian Glenna Matthews claims that weekly pay dropped from $16.33 in 1929 to $8.04 in 1933. Growers stopped working cooperatively in the fruit exchange and began selling their crops individually, competing with each other and lowering wages even further. During the New Deal, between 1933 to 1937, the federal government supported farmers by buying their crops, thus propping up prices. | In 1931 the new Cannery and Agricultural Workers Industrial Union (CAWIU) set up its state headquarters in San José at 81 Post Street, charging monthly dues of twenty-five cents for the employed and five cents for the unemployed. Dorothy Ray Healey, Elizabeth Nicholas, Pat Chambers, and Caroline Decker were among the CAWIU organizers working in the county. The CAWIU undertook thirty-seven agricultural strikes in California. Historian Glenna Matthews contends that Santa Clara County, as in the rest of the nation, saw more strikes and violence in 1933 than ever before, with three agricultural strikes and one brutal non-agricultural-related lynching. | In April of 1933, 2,000-3,000 pea pickers, composed of Mexicans and Dust Bowl migrants working near the Milpitas/De Coto County line, struck for higher wages and lost. In June 1,000 cherry pickers, mostly Spanish workers from the Mountain View area, struck for higher wages.  That same year, the cherry picker strike was considered the most violent of the three strikes in | Santa Clara County. Workers were successful and won a 50-percent raise, from twenty cents to thirty cents an hour. According to the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee Report (1936-1941), the cherry pickers were successful because the Spanish workers were homeowners and had invested in their communities, unlike the migrant Mexican and Dust Bowl pea pickers. | In August 1933 pear pickers staged a strike, CAWIU’s most successful strike in the County, largely due to organizer Caroline Decker, who gained the support of the Palo Alto Democratic Club.  In turn the Democratic Club, state and federal government officials, and the California Bureau of Labor Statistics backed the union’s right to picket, opposing the growers who had obtained an injunction against picketing workers. | The Bracero Program made it difficult to organize farmworkers throughout the Southwest, as well as Santa Clara County, because | braceros | were used as strikebreakers until the program ended in 1964. Ernesto Galarza organized agricultural strikes (though not in Santa Clara County) using the National Farm Labor Union during the 1940s and 1950s. | In 1937, workers in thirteen dried fruit companies decided to unionize. They organized the Field Practice Group and initially contracted with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), considered a “company union” less concerned with non-white members, who represented 98% of the dried fruit workers of Santa Clara County. Unlike cannery workers, in 1941 dried fruit workers left the AFL and voted for representation from the more left-wing CIO, which promoted for the largely Mexican workforce higher wages, retirement benefits, and a hiring hall instead of a shape up. | 1  of | 14 | Title: Mexican grandmother of migrant family picking tomatoes in commercial field.

According to historian Glenna Matthews, the Toilers signed a two-year contract that only benefitted male workers. Not until the 1930s did women cannery workers find a union voice. | Initially, cannery and field/orchard work were seen as components of the larger agriculture industry and excluded from government-sponsored protections afforded to industrial workers under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or The Wagner Act. By the 1930s, as more mechanization was introduced, cannery and packinghouse labor gained protections offered to industrial workers. According to historian Glenna Matthews, canners strengthened their efforts to fight unionization during the 1930s with the formation of the Canners’ League. The 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act stipulated that competing companies within an industry should cooperate, which the fractured growers resisted. | During the Great Depression, Santa Clara County canners faced a harsh economic future. Profit margins were dropping, executives took pay cuts, and small canners went out of business. According to historian Glenna Matthews, during that decade CalPak reduced production by one third. Processors tried to reduce expenses by lowering workers’ pay. | With the first dramatic decrease in wages, in 1931 cannery workers fought back with their first strike under the Cannery Agricultural Workers Industrial Union (CAWIU). Dorothy Ray Healey and Elizabeth Nicholas were among the organizers, with Dorothy taking the lead with cannery workers. A few months prior to this strike, Italian and Spanish cannery workers formed the American Labor Union and revealed the harsh conditions cannery workers faced. In 1931 the CAWIU set up picket lines at several canneries. Workers were arrested, and in July 2,000 workers held a rally in St. James Park, demanding that police release jailed picketers and triggering the worst riot in San José history. In response Richmond-Chase cannery set up machine guns at its gate, and CalPak threatened to ship its fruit to distant canneries. The strike was lost, and the CAWIU shifted its focus to unionizing agricultural workers. | The 1931 cannery strike developed future cannery union leaders who joined the struggle for worker representation led by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The AFL was seen as a “company union,” not taking the grievances of cannery workers seriously, particularly those of Mexican women. At the end of the 1930s, the AFL battled the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) for cannery worker representation and won the struggle. By the end of the 1930s, all San José canneries were unionized and remained so until the last one, Del Monte Plant #3, closed in the 1990s, with union representation shifting back and forth. In 1945 the AFL relinquished its control of Santa Clara County cannery workers to the Teamsters, who neglected the rights of non-white cannery workers. Union representation returned to the AFL, which merged with the more left-wing CIO in 1955. By the 1950s many Mexican cannery workers had gained unemployment insurance, a livable wage, and benefits for the first time. In 1967 under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, jobs could no longer be classified as “male” or “female,” so women could enter the more lucrative warehouse jobs previously controlled by men. Through the unions, Mexicans were able to earn the salaries needed to settle permanently in the | colonias | and become homeowners. | 3  of | 14 | Title:  Women Strikers at CalPak Plant #9 [California Packing Corporation Pickle Plant. became Del Monte, located at Jackson and N.

In 1911, he came to the U.S. with his mother and uncles to escape the Mexican Revolution. After losing his mother and uncle to influenza, Galarza lived in the Sacramento | barrio | working as a farm laborer. H | is surviving uncle made it possible for him to continue his education. At age eight, he knew more English than the adults in the labor camp and became | a spokesman for them, highlighting their poor living conditions. Galarza understood that education was essential and to finance his schooling, t | ook jobs as a messenger, clerk, court interpreter, and field and cannery worker. He would later chronicle his childhood in the autobiographical novel | Barrio Boy, | published in 1971. | Encouraged by his teachers, Galarza entered Occidental College in Los Angeles on a scholarship in 1923. After completing his B.A., he obtained an | M.A. in history from Stanford University and then in 1944 a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University. While at Columbia, Galarza worked for the Pan-American Union (1936-1947), serving as chief of the Division of Labor and | Social Information. Although he left this job to become a labor organizer, Galarza  was viewed as | an intellectual and scholar whose weapons were words. | Recognized as a poet, author, and educator in his later life, he taught at every level from elementary school to university and was a lifelong advocate for bilingual education. | 4  of | 14 | Title: Ernesto Galarza and wife Ann | Date: 1989 | Location: Series II, Box 6, Folder 3 | Collection: Ted Shl Archives | Source: Special Collections, SJSU Library | Additional Online Information | National Hispanic Heritage Month Profiles: Ernesto Galarza | AFL-CIO | Ernesto Galarza The Burning Light: Action and Organizing in the Mexican Community in California | Ernesto Galarza-Abo | ut | Ernesto Galarza: “Man of Fire” by Dick Meister | Ernesto Galarza NFLU and The Bracero Program | Through his research, Galarza came to understand that one of the major obstacles to unionizing Mexican farmworkers was the 1942 Mexican Farm Labor Program Agreement, better known as the Bracero Program. He left the Pan-American Union outraged by their acceptance of U.S. corporations’ exploitation of Mexican labor. In 1947 he became the director of research and education in California for the AFL-CIO’s National Farm Labor Union (NFLU) previously known as the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, which included black and white tenant farmers and agricultural laborers who organized for better wages, working conditions, and favorable legislation for small-scale farmworkers. In 1948 Galarza became vice president of the NFLU and was deeply involved in over a dozen unsuccessful strikes between 1947-1954, including tomato pickers in Tracy, cantaloupe pickers in Imperial County, and at the DiGiorgio Fruit Corporation. Outside of California, he organized sugar cane workers and strawberry pickers in Louisiana. | In 1952 NFLU became the National Agricultural Workers Union (NAWU), and Galarza became its secretary from 1954-1963. Strikes were impossible to win because braceros would replace strikers as strikebreakers, and Galarza left labor organizing determined to use his writing skills as a weapon to help end the Bracero Program. | Galarza had visited bracero camps and saw firsthand how employers used braceros to break strikes and avoid union organizing.  Bracero labor also depressed wages for American workers. Galarza exposed abuses within the Bracero Program in his best-known work, | Merchants of Labor | (1964), which helped to end the program and laid the groundwork for César Chávez to begin the United Farm Workers of America (UFWA) in 1965. | Galarza became a labor organizer because he believed that to achieve civil rights, Mexican Americans and labor unions needed to work together to address workplace and community problems. Between 1963-1964, Galarza served as advisor to the U.S. House Committee on Education and Labor. In 1979, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature for his writing on braceros. | 5  of | 14 | Title:  NFLU Leadership c. 1940s | Collection and No: Ernesto Galarza Papers | Source:: Special Collections, Greene Library, Stanford University Libraries, Stanford, Calif. | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Legal Challenges to Segregation | School segregation was a major issue for Mexicans in California and Texas. Groups of parents filed numerous lawsuits to push local governments to integrate local schools. These struggles united parent groups and LULAC (The League of United Latin American Citizens), and together they fought landmark cases such as | Del Rio ISD v. Salvatierra | in Texas (1930) and | Roberto Alvarez v. the Board of Trustees of the Lemon Grove School District, | often referred to as “The Lemon Grove Incident,” in San Diego, California (1931). | LULAC, the first national Mexican American Civil Rights organization, was established in 1929 by American citizens of Mexican descent in Corpus Christi, Texas. Until WWII, LULAC undertook several school desegregation court cases in Texas and California using the argument that Mexicans were white.  Accordingly, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) gave American citizenship to Mexicans living in the U.S. territory at the end of the Mexican American War while the U.S.Constitution had stipulated that only white males were eligible for U.S. citizenship. This legal argument was not successful. | After WWII, LULAC worked with the Mexican consulate and the NAACP to strategize for | Mendez v. Westminster | (1947). This California Supreme Court case repealed all segregation in California schools, arguing that the 14th Amendment provided for “equal protection” under the law, and influenced the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case | Brown v. Board of Education Topeka, Kansas | . In 1954, lawyers from the American G.I. Forum and LULAC argued in the U.S. Supreme Court case of | Hernandez v. Texas | that the Mexican American defendant was denied “equal protection” under the 14th Amendment. The court granted that Mexican Americans were “a class apart,” not easily fitting into a legal structure that only recognized blacks and whites. Direct action on segregation, including strikes, walkouts, and boycotts, would come much later. | 6  of | 14 | Title: Mayfair School Class Portrait with Christmas Tree, c. 1940 | Date: 1935-1950 | Collection: History San José Online Catalog | Owning Institution: History San José Research Library | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/ac5699114d7befb729677d8c6cae3988/ | Additional Online Information | The League of United Latin-American Citizens: A Texas-Mexican Civic Organization | Del Rio ISD v.

Anglo American GIs shared bunkrooms, meals, and social time with their Mexican counterparts and understood that they had to rely on one another in combat. Although Mexican Americans did not face the same level of segregation in the military as African Americans and lighter skinned Mexicans were sometimes classified as white, they understood that racial prejudice still remained. | As Mexican veterans returned home, they continued the fight for the “Double V for Victory”–victory against racism abroad and at home. When Mexican American veterans were banned from participating in local veterans’ groups and denied services at veterans’ hospitals or military cemeteries, in 1948 they formed the American G.I. Forum, which welcomed all veterans of color. | The GI Forum was founded in Texas by Dr. Hector P. García to fight discrimination against Mexican Americans in employment, education, and access to veterans’ benefits. The organization gained national attention when it took up the Felix Longoria case in 1949. Longoria, an ethnic Mexican veteran from Texas killed in the Philippines, was refused burial in his hometown, Three Rivers, Texas. The GI Forum appealed to then-Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, who had seen discrimination first hand in Texas after teaching in a segregated school for Mexican Americans. In the Longoria case, Johnson intervened, arranging for him to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors at no cost to his family. | The San José chapter of the Forum was formed in 1949, focusing on youth issues and offering scholarships. In 1960, the Forum collaborated with other groups, such as the Community Service Organization (CSO), on voter registration campaigns and advocating for ethnic, minority and disenfranchised communities. | 7  of | 14 | Title:  Conrado Barrientos US Air Force, WWII | Collection:  Before Silicon Valley Project Archives, Barrientos Collection | Owning Institution: Special Collections, San Jose State University | Additional Online Information | American G.I.

Initially Fr. McDonald served at St. Joseph Church in the Mountain View | colonia | (1947-1951), encouraging the formation of Club Estrella as well as a community credit union. In 1952 he moved to Eastside San José and introduced parishioners to non-violent community organizing strategies, urging them to address racial discrimination through action. Known as “Father Mac,” he was familiar with Ernesto Galarza’s writings and agricultural union organizing, and instructed parishioners on labor law, focusing on abuses of the Bracero Program. | The Eastside had no Catholic church to serve the growing Mexican population, and Father Mac helped parishioners to establish the Guadalupe Chapel. In 1953, the Catholic Church purchased an old church building, disassembled it, and moved it to the Mayfair district. It was reconstructed by parish volunteers, including siblings César and Richard Chávez and their sister Rita Chávez Medina. The building housed the growing Our Lady of Guadalupe congregation until it was replaced in 1968. The chapel also served as the first headquarters of the San José chapter of the Community Service Organization (CSO), which trained community organizers and conducted campaigns for social justice and labor rights. Because of this history, Fr. McDonnell Hall, originally the Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places (2016) and became a National Historic Landmark in 2017 | . | 8  of | 14 | Filename: Guadalupe Mission, c. late 1950s.  Cropped-Guadalupe Church Photo Album-Chavez Photos-7595.tif | Collection:  Before Silicon Valley Project Archives, Guadalupe Church Photo Album | Owning Institution: Special Collections, San Jose State University | (after Sept 30, 2023) | Additional Online Information | Mission Guadalupe of San José | San José Building With Chávez Ties Named National Historic Landmark | KQED | The CSO and Fred Ross | According to historian Gabriel Thompson, Fred Ross, Sr., was born to an affluent and politically conservative family from Los Angeles. He attended the University of Southern California, where he was exposed to politically liberal ideas. Ross wanted to be a teacher, but after his graduation in 1936, due to the Depression, he took a three-year term as a relief worker. He then became manager of the federally-funded Farm Security Administration (FSA) Arvin Migratory Camp for Dust Bowl migrants located near Bakersfield. He replaced the previous corrupt manager and tried to regain the workers’ confidence by forming a workers’ council and supporting a cotton strike. During his time at Arvin Camp, he met folk singer Woody Guthrie and listened to his songs of political protest. | During WWII Ross worked for the War Relocation Authority in Cleveland, finding jobs and housing for Japanese Americans not placed in internment camps. After WWII, he returned to Los Angeles to work for the American Council on Race Relations, organizing “multi-racial unity leagues.”  He led voter registration drives to force out racist local politicians and desegregate schools.  His work contributed to the successful 1948 California State Supreme Court decision in | Mendez v. Westminster | . Ross also worked for Saul Alinsky’s Chicago-based Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF). In 1947 he was hired to promote Latino political power in Los Angeles. | That same year, in Boyle Heights, a Los Angeles neighborhood with a large Mexican population, Ross formed the first chapter of the | Community Service Organization (CSO), | which was established | to protect | the civil rights of Mexican Americans and foster political and civic engagement. Fred Ross approached social worker Edward Roybal and Antonio Rios, a union organizer with the United Steelworkers of America, with the idea of forming a community-based organization. In the IAF model, an outside organizer works with local leaders to create a democratic organization where people can identify their concerns and address them through direct action. Edward Roybal became the first president and main spokesman of the CSO’s LA Chapter. | Building on the earlier work of | mutualistas | , church groups, and community associations, the CSO stressed voter registration and held citizenship classes to promote political involvement. They also addressed ongoing problems such as poor community services and discrimination in housing, education, and employment. After WWII, Mexican American and African American civil rights groups occasionally worked together, though they sometimes differed in their aims and goals. For example, education was an important issue for both groups, but bilingual education was extremely important to Mexican Americans, while busing was a higher priority for African Americans. Fair housing and employment legislation were key issues for both, but Mexicans prioritized pensions for resident non-citizens, who were often not eligible for social services. | CSO members learned the importance of becoming activists in their own communities. By 1963, the CSO had 34 chapters across the Southwest, registering 500,000 new voters and helping over 50,000 Mexican immigrants obtain citizenship in California. In 1949, | utilizing the community organizing skills of Fred Ross, Sr., and CSO volunteers, Edward Roybal was elected to the Los Angeles City Council. The first Mexican to win a seat since 1881, Roybal was later elected to Congress, serving from 1963 to 1993. | 9  of | 14 | Title:  Fred Ross, 1950s | Collections:  Fred Ross Papers | Source:  Special Collections, Greene Library, Stanford University Libraries, Stanford, CA | Additional Online Information | The Community Service Organization (CSO) | Guide to Community Service Organization History Project Records | César Chavez | Fred Ross - Zinn Education Project | Guide to the Fred Ross Papers | Meet the Long-Forgotten Organizer Who Inspired Cesar Chavez to Become an Activist | The Nation | The Formation of the San José Chapter of the CSO | In 1951 San José State College sociology professor and American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) member Claude Settles brought Fred Ross, Sr., to campus to give a lecture. Herman Gallegos, a student, and Leonard Ramirez and public health nurse Alicia Hernández, two community members, attended that lecture and encouraged Ross to organize a new CSO chapter in the | barrio | known as “Sal Sí Puedes | “ (meaning “Get Out if You Can,” a name that can be traced back to a Mexican land grant) in the Mayfair district of | East San José. | Assigned to a project in Kansas City, Ross reached out to his contacts in Santa Clara to provide local assistance and support. One of these was Quaker philanthropist and AFSC member Josephine Duveneck of Los Altos Hills. Duveneck initially provided housing for Fred Ross, Sr., a place to hold meetings, and financial support. In 1952 Ross was assigned by Saul Alinsky to work in San José, and shortly upon arrival, he sought out Father McDonnell to help identify potential organizers, such as Guadalupe-parish member César Chávez. | Ross’s community organizing techniques were based on door-to-door canvassing and house meetings. Volunteers such as Rita Chávez Medina (César’s sister), Herman Gallegos, and César Chávez went door-to-door in the Eastside’s crowded neighborhoods, over unpaved streets, registering voters and talking to residents about how to form a CSO Chapter. The community was ready, and the formational meeting took place at Mayfair Elementary School in 1952. Meetings were later moved to the Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel, where the CSO established its first offices, local campaigns were planned and organized, and volunteers were trained | . | 10  of | 14 | Filename: FAIR USE_HSJ The Weekly Mayfair_Flooding East Side_Jan 17 1952_CROP_2006791.jpg | Objectid:  2006-79-1 | Caption: Mayfair_19520117_p01 | Owning Institution: History San Jose | Permalink: | https://historysanjose.pastperfectonline.com/media/947D46E1-8C99-4AA2-B387-450801468900 | The Founding Members of the CSO San José Chapter, Excluding Cesar Chavez | The following are some of the founding members of the CSO San José Chapter: | Herman Gallegos became the first president of the San José Chapter as well as president of the national CSO in 1960. Gallegos grew up in a poor coal-mining family who lived in a mud hut built by his father near the mines in Ludlow, Colorado, where he observed the infamous “Ludlow Massacre” of striking workers. After the massacre, the family moved to San Francisco. Gallegos first attended San Francisco State University, where  two of his professors, Dr. John Beecher and Dr. Herbert Bisno, refused to sign a loyalty oath required under the Levering Act affirming that the signer was an American and not a Communist or risk being fired. When a state police officer came into the classroom and handed Dr. Beecher a letter requiring him to leave, Gallegos and two Jewish students walked out of class and went to the administration office demanding the professor be reinstated. | Because the protesting students did not have a permit, the police broke up the protest, and Gallegos decided to transfer to the | Social Work Program at San José State College. | When he joined the CSO, he was attending college, living on the Eastside, and working as a gas station attendant. At that time he and Hernández were the only two members of the organization with a college education. In 1960 Gallegos became national CSO president, with César Chávez serving as executive director. | Alicia | Hernández, a public health nurse who worked with families on the Eastside, became a founding member after attending Fred Ross’ first talk at San José State College (with Herman Gallegos, Juan Marcoida, and Leonard Ramierez). She became the first temporary chair or interim president of the CSO San José chapter. A friend of Chávez’ wife Helen, Hernández arranged the first meeting between Ross and César Chávez, who was 25 years old. Hernández and Chávez walked door to door in the Eastside registering voters. | Juan Marcoida, another student who heard Ross’s initial talk at San José State, was an engineer who worked by day and went to college at night. He became a founding member of the CSO San José Chapter while working at the General Electric Plant, where he’d been employed since its opening in 1947. A resident of Sal Sí Puedes in the Eastside, Marcoida served two terms as president of the CSO San José Chapter. He also hosted a radio program called CSO INFORME that aired for ten years on KLOK and KSJO radio stations, highlighting jobs, legal issues, police brutality, domestic abuse, immigration, deportation, scams, and voter registration assistance. He was named “1956 Man of the Year” in | El Excentrico | magazine. | Rita Chávez Medina, the eldest of the Chávez siblings, had quit school at age 12 to help support the family after they lost their farm. She continued to work in the fields, transitioning into cannery work when she married and her family moved to San José. There she became active in local efforts to obtain a Catholic church to serve the Mexican community in the Eastside, enlisting the help of her brothers César and Richard, a union carpenter. She had already demonstrated her organizing skills in the church campaign when César asked her to work on the CSO voter registration drive, and he increasingly delegated local organizing tasks to her. Rita rose to become CSO San José Chapter President. | Leonard Ramirez, who also heard Ross’ speech, and his wife Erma became founding members of the CSO San José Chapter, fighting for paved streets and street lighting as well as promoting voter registration. Ramirez led the CSO drive to abolish citizenship requirements to receive Social Security benefits for old age. The law was revised in 1960 taking out Social Securities citizenship requirement. Ramirez was born in Watts, California, in 1926. After high school, he joined the army during WWII. Through the help of the GI Bill, he graduated from San José State College in 1953, one of only five Mexican students attending the university. | 11  of | 14 | Filename: FAIR USE_HSJ The Weekly Mayfair_Flooding East Side_Jan 17 1952_CROP_2006791.jpg | Objectid:  2006-79-1 | Caption: Mayfair_19520117_p01 | Owning Institution: History San Jose | Permalink: | https://historysanjose.pastperfectonline.com/media/947D46E1-8C99-4AA2-B387-450801468900 | The Background, Recruitment and Rise of César Chávez to the CSO | César Chávez was born in 1927, the second of six children in an extended family of devout Catholics, and grew up on his grandparents’ family farm near Yuma, Arizona. In 1939, during the Depression, the farm was auctioned and sold to cover back taxes. César’s father had been diagnosed with a lung disease requiring a move to a cooler climate, and the family joined the growing number of American migrant workers in California. Unlike sister Rita, who quit school at 12 years of age to work in the fields full time, Césario (César) carried family expectations as the eldest boy and was allowed to attend school while working in the fields weekends and holidays. Eventually, he and his family worked across California from Brawley to Oxnard, Atascadero, Gonzales, King City, Salinas, McFarland, Delano, Wasco, Selma, Kingsburg, and Mendota. The essential injustice and underlying racism the family experienced during those years made a strong impression on César. Despite the numerous interruptions to his education, he graduated from the eighth grade in June 1942 and became a full-time farm laborer until he joined the Navy in 1945. | A Navy veteran by 1947, Chávez returned to working with the family as an agricultural laborer. He joined the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU), picking cotton in Corcoran, near Delano. Cesar and his brother Richard both worked briefly in the lumber yards of Crescent City. However, the distance was too far from the rest of the family in San José, so by the 1950s, their sister Rita encouraged César and Richard to relocate their families to San José. Richard became a successful union carpenter, and César continued working in the fields and local lumber yards when, at 25 years of age, he met Fred Ross, Sr., in 1952. | When Ross had begun to look for local organizers for the CSO, Alicia Hernández offered to introduce him to her friend Helen Chávez and her husband César, who had become active in social justice work through his association with Father McDonnell, pastor of the Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel. Through Fr. McDonnell, Chávez had learned the principles of nonviolent resistance and been introduced to Catholic teachings that emphasized social justice and challenged economic and social inequalities. With Father Mac, Chávez had visited labor camps and farmworkers living beyond the Eastside. | Fred Ross encouraged Chávez to become a full-time paid organizer for the Community Services Organization (CSO), and he soon began setting up chapters in the Bay Area and other towns across the state. Named executive director of the national CSO in 1959, Chávez moved to Los Angeles to work in the organization's main office. Though the CSO had become a successful advocate for communities of color, Chávez had not given up the idea of working with farmworkers and felt that the CSO was more focused on the problems of urban communities. In 1962 he left the CSO and moved to Delano, California, with his wife, their eight children, brother Richard Chávez, and Dolores Huerta, another CSO colleague from Stockton, in order to establish a union for farm laborers, the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) | 12  of | 14 | Filename: FAIR USE_HSJ The Weekly Mayfair_Flooding East Side_Jan 17 1952_CROP_2006791.jpg | Objectid:  2006-79-1 | Caption: Mayfair_19520117_p01 | Owning Institution: History San Jose | Permalink: | https://historysanjose.pastperfectonline.com/media/947D46E1-8C99-4AA2-B387-450801468900 | Additional Online Information | Cesar Chavez Special Resource Study and Environmental Assessment | Padilla, Ruiz Introduce Legislation to Create the César E. Chávez and the Farmworker Movement National Park | César E. Chávez National Monument (U.S. National Park Service) | CSO San José Chapter Organizing Tactics | In San José, CSO organizers held house meetings where they identified community concerns, which became the focus of their campaigns, and recruited potential members and volunteers. Formal meetings were then held at the Mayfair School to create an official organization. The main issues of concern to Eastside residents included improving essential services, paving streets, installing streetlights, dealing with police brutality, and addressing economic inequality. Due to the anti-communist fervor of | the early 1950s, it was important to involve religious leaders like Fr. McDonnell to assure the authorities that CSO members were not Communists or political agitators, s | o the opportunity to hold regular meetings at the Chapel was welcomed. | Articles in | El Excentrico | introduced more people to the organization and emphasized its roots in the local community. Juan Marcoida, CSO member and chapter president, hosted a radio program, CSO INFORME, for ten years on KLOK and KSJO radio stations, with businesses donating to cover airtime costs. CSO services were provided free of charge, and, with so many people in need of help, fundraising was continuous–donated Christmas trees and tamales were sold, musicians played for free at dances, and members held raffles and ran a secondhand store. | Prior to World War II, only a small percentage of Mexican immigrants had filed naturalization papers since citizenship did not appear to improve their working or living conditions. CSO members learned that some problems required legislative remedies to develop better public policy, which made citizenship, and thus citizenship classes, more important. The CSO became part of a civil-rights coalition, including the NAACP, the Urban League, the Jewish Community Relations Committee, the Japanese American Citizens League, and other organizations that met regularly to frame the strategy for public policy involvement in California. By increasing their political power through citizenship classes and voter registration, these groups fought discrimination in education, housing, and employment on local and state levels. In the 1950s, the CSO San José Chapter lobbied to end citizenship requirements for Social Security benefits and promoted voter registration drives with the assistance of the G.I. Forum and worked with the NAACP to challenge discrimination of Mexicans against African Americans. | 13  of | 14 | Filename: FAIR USE_HSJ The Weekly Mayfair_Flooding East Side_Jan 17 1952_CROP_2006791.jpg | Objectid:  2006-79-1 | Caption: Mayfair_19520117_p01 | Owning Institution: History San Jose | Permalink: | https://historysanjose.pastperfectonline.com/media/947D46E1-8C99-4AA2-B387-450801468900 | Life After the CSO:  Some of the Founding Leaders of the San José Chapter | Alicia Hernandez, who did not like being in the spotlight that can accompany a leadership role, moved to San Francisco to continue nursing. | Leonard Ramierez became a probation officer and helped to open the James Ranch Juvenile facility in Morgan Hill (William F. James Boys Ranch). He became chair of the United Way of Santa Clara County, a founder of the Hispanic Development Corporation, and a member of the GI Forum. | After leaving the CSO in the early 1960s, Fred Ross helped organize residents of Guadalupe, Arizona, primarily Mexican Americans and Yaqui Indians, to gain basic services such as paved roads and stop signs. He then taught organizing skills to students at Syracuse University working on a campaign, supported by federal “War on Poverty'' funds, to organize African American residents living in dilapidated public housing. The idea of paying organizers with government funds to stir up people to challenge government policies proved controversial, and the funding was eventually halted. Returning to California in 1966, Ross became the organizing director of the United | Farm Workers Association | .  He assisted the UFW in a campaign over who would represent workers at DiGiorgio, a major grower in the San Joaquin Valley. He would spend the late 1960s and 70s assisting Chávez and the UFW with various elections and boycotts, training thousands of UFW volunteers in his organizing methods. Well into the 1980s, he trained a number of groups working on a broad range of issues, from U.S. intervention in Central America to nuclear disarmament. One of his favorite axioms described the role of the organizer: “A good organizer is a social arsonist who goes around setting people on fire.” | Recruited by Saul Alinsky to become a full-time organizer, Herman Gallegos decided to pursue his career in social work and received his Masters in Social Work (MSW) from U.C. Berkeley, becoming an advocate for Chicano youth and active in the local CSO. After graduation, Gallegos worked as a district director with the San Bernardino County Council of Community Services, a social planning demonstration project supported by the Rosenberg Foundation. | In 1965, Gallegos | , Dr. Ernesto Galarza, and Dr. Julian Samora were recruited by the Ford Foundation to | serve as national affairs consultants. The group explored potential  philanthropic support, making recommendations and identifying solutions to address the growing needs of Latino communities. | Gallegos went on to become executive director of the National Council of La Raza in 1968, co-founder of Hispanics in Philanthropy, and a U.S. public delegate to the 49th General Assembly of the United Nations. | César Chávez left the CSO because of its emphasis on urban social justice issues. In 1962 he and Dolores Huerta co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (later the United Farm Workers of | America | ). Chávez believed i | t was important that the new union succeed through nonviolent tactics (boycotts, pickets, and strikes). Although Chávez’s methods as an organizer and labor leader were sometimes controversial, the movement he led brought farmworkers dignity and self-respect, as well as better wages and working conditions. In California, he pushed through what remains today the most pro-labor law in the country, the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, granting farm workers the right to organize and petition for union elections. As stated in the César Chávez Special Resource Study, issued by the National Park Service in 2012: “César Chávez is recognized for his achievements as the charismatic leader of the farm labor movement and the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), the first permanent agricultural labor union in the history of the United States. The most important Latino leader in the U.S. during the twentieth century, Chávez emerged as a civil rights leader among Latinos during the 1950s. Moreover, Chávez and the UFW sought to inspire all men and women to respect the dignity of labor, the importance of community, and the power of peaceful protest.“ | The legacy of these organizers from an earlier time can be seen in the work of a generation of activists and community organizers who joined the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s and '70s, transforming their lives and inspiring the activism that continues through today. | 14  of | 14 | Previous | Next | Mexican Farm Worker Unionization, 1930-1960 | During the Great Depression, ethnic Mexicans viewed labor organizing campaigns as part of the promise of equality and civil rights. During this time, Santa Clara County saw some of the most significant agricultural strikes in the U.S., many involving Mexican workers. Before WWII, most Mexicans worked on farms in the fruit and nut orchards or tomato and pea field/row crops. The Depression of the 1930s saw a deterioration in working conditions and a dramatic decrease in pay for orchard and field workers, who were paid by piece work rather than hourly wages. Historian Glenna Matthews claims that weekly pay dropped from $16.33 in 1929 to $8.04 in 1933. Growers stopped working cooperatively in the fruit exchange and began selling their crops individually, competing with each other and lowering wages even further. During the New Deal, between 1933 to 1937, the federal government supported farmers by buying their crops, thus propping up prices. | In 1931 the new Cannery and Agricultural Workers Industrial Union (CAWIU) set up its state headquarters in San José at 81 Post Street, charging monthly dues of twenty-five cents for the employed and five cents for the unemployed. Dorothy Ray Healey, Elizabeth Nicholas, Pat Chambers, and Caroline Decker were among the CAWIU organizers working in the county. The CAWIU undertook thirty-seven agricultural strikes in California. Historian Glenna Matthews contends that Santa Clara County, as in the rest of the nation, saw more strikes and violence in 1933 than ever before, with three agricultural strikes and one brutal non-agricultural-related lynching. | In April of 1933, 2,000-3,000 pea pickers, composed of Mexicans and Dust Bowl migrants working near the Milpitas/De Coto County line, struck for higher wages and lost.

Workers were successful and won a 50-percent raise, from twenty cents to thirty cents an hour. According to the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee Report (1936-1941), the cherry pickers were successful because the Spanish workers were homeowners and had invested in their communities, unlike the migrant Mexican and Dust Bowl pea pickers. | In August 1933 pear pickers staged a strike, CAWIU’s most successful strike in the County, largely due to organizer Caroline Decker, who gained the support of the Palo Alto Democratic Club.  In turn the Democratic Club, state and federal government officials, and the California Bureau of Labor Statistics backed the union’s right to picket, opposing the growers who had obtained an injunction against picketing workers. | The Bracero Program made it difficult to organize farmworkers throughout the Southwest, as well as Santa Clara County, because | braceros | were used as strikebreakers until the program ended in 1964.

Unlike cannery workers, in 1941 dried fruit workers left the AFL and voted for representation from the more left-wing CIO, which promoted for the largely Mexican workforce higher wages, retirement benefits, and a hiring hall instead of a shape up. | Title: Mexican grandmother of migrant family picking tomatoes in commercial field.

According to historian Glenna Matthews, the Toilers signed a two-year contract that only benefitted male workers. Not until the 1930s did women cannery workers find a union voice. | Initially, cannery and field/orchard work were seen as components of the larger agriculture industry and excluded from government-sponsored protections afforded to industrial workers under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or The Wagner Act. By the 1930s, as more mechanization was introduced, cannery and packinghouse labor gained protections offered to industrial workers. According to historian Glenna Matthews, canners strengthened their efforts to fight unionization during the 1930s with the formation of the Canners’ League. The 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act stipulated that competing companies within an industry should cooperate, which the fractured growers resisted. | During the Great Depression, Santa Clara County canners faced a harsh economic future. Profit margins were dropping, executives took pay cuts, and small canners went out of business. According to historian Glenna Matthews, during that decade CalPak reduced production by one third. Processors tried to reduce expenses by lowering workers’ pay. | With the first dramatic decrease in wages, in 1931 cannery workers fought back with their first strike under the Cannery Agricultural Workers Industrial Union (CAWIU). Dorothy Ray Healey and Elizabeth Nicholas were among the organizers, with Dorothy taking the lead with cannery workers. A few months prior to this strike, Italian and Spanish cannery workers formed the American Labor Union and revealed the harsh conditions cannery workers faced. In 1931 the CAWIU set up picket lines at several canneries. Workers were arrested, and in July 2,000 workers held a rally in St. James Park, demanding that police release jailed picketers and triggering the worst riot in San José history. In response Richmond-Chase cannery set up machine guns at its gate, and CalPak threatened to ship its fruit to distant canneries. The strike was lost, and the CAWIU shifted its focus to unionizing agricultural workers. | The 1931 cannery strike developed future cannery union leaders who joined the struggle for worker representation led by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The AFL was seen as a “company union,” not taking the grievances of cannery workers seriously, particularly those of Mexican women. At the end of the 1930s, the AFL battled the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) for cannery worker representation and won the struggle. By the end of the 1930s, all San José canneries were unionized and remained so until the last one, Del Monte Plant #3, closed in the 1990s, with union representation shifting back and forth. In 1945 the AFL relinquished its control of Santa Clara County cannery workers to the Teamsters, who neglected the rights of non-white cannery workers. Union representation returned to the AFL, which merged with the more left-wing CIO in 1955. By the 1950s many Mexican cannery workers had gained unemployment insurance, a livable wage, and benefits for the first time. In 1967 under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, jobs could no longer be classified as “male” or “female,” so women could enter the more lucrative warehouse jobs previously controlled by men. Through the unions, Mexicans were able to earn the salaries needed to settle permanently in the | colonias | and become homeowners. | Title:  Women Strikers at CalPak Plant #9 [California Packing Corporation Pickle Plant. became Del Monte, located at Jackson and N.

In 1911, he came to the U.S. with his mother and uncles to escape the Mexican Revolution. After losing his mother and uncle to influenza, Galarza lived in the Sacramento | barrio | working as a farm laborer. H | is surviving uncle made it possible for him to continue his education. At age eight, he knew more English than the adults in the labor camp and became | a spokesman for them, highlighting their poor living conditions. Galarza understood that education was essential and to finance his schooling, t | ook jobs as a messenger, clerk, court interpreter, and field and cannery worker. He would later chronicle his childhood in the autobiographical novel | Barrio Boy, | published in 1971. | Encouraged by his teachers, Galarza entered Occidental College in Los Angeles on a scholarship in 1923. After completing his B.A., he obtained an | M.A. in history from Stanford University and then in 1944 a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University. While at Columbia, Galarza worked for the Pan-American Union (1936-1947), serving as chief of the Division of Labor and | Social Information. Although he left this job to become a labor organizer, Galarza  was viewed as | an intellectual and scholar whose weapons were words. | Recognized as a poet, author, and educator in his later life, he taught at every level from elementary school to university and was a lifelong advocate for bilingual education. | Title: Ernesto Galarza and wife Ann | Date: 1989 | Location: Series II, Box 6, Folder 3 | Collection: Ted Shl Archives | Source: Special Collections, SJSU Library | Additional Online Information | National Hispanic Heritage Month Profiles: Ernesto Galarza | AFL-CIO | Ernesto Galarza The Burning Light: Action and Organizing in the Mexican Community in California | Ernesto Galarza-Abo | ut | Ernesto Galarza: “Man of Fire” by Dick Meister | Ernesto Galarza NFLU and The Bracero Program | Through his research, Galarza came to understand that one of the major obstacles to unionizing Mexican farmworkers was the 1942 Mexican Farm Labor Program Agreement, better known as the Bracero Program. He left the Pan-American Union outraged by their acceptance of U.S. corporations’ exploitation of Mexican labor. In 1947 he became the director of research and education in California for the AFL-CIO’s National Farm Labor Union (NFLU) previously known as the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, which included black and white tenant farmers and agricultural laborers who organized for better wages, working conditions, and favorable legislation for small-scale farmworkers. In 1948 Galarza became vice president of the NFLU and was deeply involved in over a dozen unsuccessful strikes between 1947-1954, including tomato pickers in Tracy, cantaloupe pickers in Imperial County, and at the DiGiorgio Fruit Corporation. Outside of California, he organized sugar cane workers and strawberry pickers in Louisiana. | In 1952 NFLU became the National Agricultural Workers Union (NAWU), and Galarza became its secretary from 1954-1963. Strikes were impossible to win because braceros would replace strikers as strikebreakers, and Galarza left labor organizing determined to use his writing skills as a weapon to help end the Bracero Program. | Galarza had visited bracero camps and saw firsthand how employers used braceros to break strikes and avoid union organizing.  Bracero labor also depressed wages for American workers. Galarza exposed abuses within the Bracero Program in his best-known work, | Merchants of Labor | (1964), which helped to end the program and laid the groundwork for César Chávez to begin the United Farm Workers of America (UFWA) in 1965. | Galarza became a labor organizer because he believed that to achieve civil rights, Mexican Americans and labor unions needed to work together to address workplace and community problems. Between 1963-1964, Galarza served as advisor to the U.S. House Committee on Education and Labor. In 1979, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature for his writing on braceros. | Title:  NFLU Leadership c. 1940s | Collection and No: Ernesto Galarza Papers | Source:: Special Collections, Greene Library, Stanford University Libraries, Stanford, Calif. | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Legal Challenges to Segregation | School segregation was a major issue for Mexicans in California and Texas. Groups of parents filed numerous lawsuits to push local governments to integrate local schools. These struggles united parent groups and LULAC (The League of United Latin American Citizens), and together they fought landmark cases such as | Del Rio ISD v. Salvatierra | in Texas (1930) and | Roberto Alvarez v. the Board of Trustees of the Lemon Grove School District, | often referred to as “The Lemon Grove Incident,” in San Diego, California (1931). | LULAC, the first national Mexican American Civil Rights organization, was established in 1929 by American citizens of Mexican descent in Corpus Christi, Texas. Until WWII, LULAC undertook several school desegregation court cases in Texas and California using the argument that Mexicans were white.  Accordingly, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) gave American citizenship to Mexicans living in the U.S. territory at the end of the Mexican American War while the U.S.Constitution had stipulated that only white males were eligible for U.S. citizenship. This legal argument was not successful. | After WWII, LULAC worked with the Mexican consulate and the NAACP to strategize for | Mendez v. Westminster | (1947). This California Supreme Court case repealed all segregation in California schools, arguing that the 14th Amendment provided for “equal protection” under the law, and influenced the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case | Brown v. Board of Education Topeka, Kansas | . In 1954, lawyers from the American G.I. Forum and LULAC argued in the U.S. Supreme Court case of | Hernandez v. Texas | that the Mexican American defendant was denied “equal protection” under the 14th Amendment. The court granted that Mexican Americans were “a class apart,” not easily fitting into a legal structure that only recognized blacks and whites. Direct action on segregation, including strikes, walkouts, and boycotts, would come much later. | Title: Mayfair School Class Portrait with Christmas Tree, c. 1940 | Date: 1935-1950 | Collection: History San José Online Catalog | Owning Institution: History San José Research Library | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/ac5699114d7befb729677d8c6cae3988/ | Additional Online Information | The League of United Latin-American Citizens: A Texas-Mexican Civic Organization | Del Rio ISD v.

Anglo American GIs shared bunkrooms, meals, and social time with their Mexican counterparts and understood that they had to rely on one another in combat. Although Mexican Americans did not face the same level of segregation in the military as African Americans and lighter skinned Mexicans were sometimes classified as white, they understood that racial prejudice still remained. | As Mexican veterans returned home, they continued the fight for the “Double V for Victory”–victory against racism abroad and at home. When Mexican American veterans were banned from participating in local veterans’ groups and denied services at veterans’ hospitals or military cemeteries, in 1948 they formed the American G.I. Forum, which welcomed all veterans of color. | The GI Forum was founded in Texas by Dr. Hector P. García to fight discrimination against Mexican Americans in employment, education, and access to veterans’ benefits. The organization gained national attention when it took up the Felix Longoria case in 1949. Longoria, an ethnic Mexican veteran from Texas killed in the Philippines, was refused burial in his hometown, Three Rivers, Texas. The GI Forum appealed to then-Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, who had seen discrimination first hand in Texas after teaching in a segregated school for Mexican Americans. In the Longoria case, Johnson intervened, arranging for him to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors at no cost to his family. | The San José chapter of the Forum was formed in 1949, focusing on youth issues and offering scholarships. In 1960, the Forum collaborated with other groups, such as the Community Service Organization (CSO), on voter registration campaigns and advocating for ethnic, minority and disenfranchised communities. | Title:  Conrado Barrientos US Air Force, WWII | Collection:  Before Silicon Valley Project Archives, Barrientos Collection | Owning Institution: Special Collections, San Jose State University | Additional Online Information | American G.I.

Initially Fr. McDonald served at St. Joseph Church in the Mountain View | colonia | (1947-1951), encouraging the formation of Club Estrella as well as a community credit union. In 1952 he moved to Eastside San José and introduced parishioners to non-violent community organizing strategies, urging them to address racial discrimination through action. Known as “Father Mac,” he was familiar with Ernesto Galarza’s writings and agricultural union organizing, and instructed parishioners on labor law, focusing on abuses of the Bracero Program. | The Eastside had no Catholic church to serve the growing Mexican population, and Father Mac helped parishioners to establish the Guadalupe Chapel. In 1953, the Catholic Church purchased an old church building, disassembled it, and moved it to the Mayfair district. It was reconstructed by parish volunteers, including siblings César and Richard Chávez and their sister Rita Chávez Medina. The building housed the growing Our Lady of Guadalupe congregation until it was replaced in 1968. The chapel also served as the first headquarters of the San José chapter of the Community Service Organization (CSO), which trained community organizers and conducted campaigns for social justice and labor rights. Because of this history, Fr. McDonnell Hall, originally the Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places (2016) and became a National Historic Landmark in 2017 | . | Filename: Guadalupe Mission, c. late 1950s.  Cropped-Guadalupe Church Photo Album-Chavez Photos-7595.tif | Collection:  Before Silicon Valley Project Archives, Guadalupe Church Photo Album | Owning Institution: Special Collections, San Jose State University | (after Sept 30, 2023) | Additional Online Information | Mission Guadalupe of San José | San José Building With Chávez Ties Named National Historic Landmark | KQED | The CSO and Fred Ross | According to historian Gabriel Thompson, Fred Ross, Sr., was born to an affluent and politically conservative family from Los Angeles. He attended the University of Southern California, where he was exposed to politically liberal ideas. Ross wanted to be a teacher, but after his graduation in 1936, due to the Depression, he took a three-year term as a relief worker. He then became manager of the federally-funded Farm Security Administration (FSA) Arvin Migratory Camp for Dust Bowl migrants located near Bakersfield. He replaced the previous corrupt manager and tried to regain the workers’ confidence by forming a workers’ council and supporting a cotton strike. During his time at Arvin Camp, he met folk singer Woody Guthrie and listened to his songs of political protest. | During WWII Ross worked for the War Relocation Authority in Cleveland, finding jobs and housing for Japanese Americans not placed in internment camps. After WWII, he returned to Los Angeles to work for the American Council on Race Relations, organizing “multi-racial unity leagues.”  He led voter registration drives to force out racist local politicians and desegregate schools.  His work contributed to the successful 1948 California State Supreme Court decision in | Mendez v. Westminster | . Ross also worked for Saul Alinsky’s Chicago-based Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF). In 1947 he was hired to promote Latino political power in Los Angeles. | That same year, in Boyle Heights, a Los Angeles neighborhood with a large Mexican population, Ross formed the first chapter of the | Community Service Organization (CSO), | which was established | to protect | the civil rights of Mexican Americans and foster political and civic engagement. Fred Ross approached social worker Edward Roybal and Antonio Rios, a union organizer with the United Steelworkers of America, with the idea of forming a community-based organization. In the IAF model, an outside organizer works with local leaders to create a democratic organization where people can identify their concerns and address them through direct action. Edward Roybal became the first president and main spokesman of the CSO’s LA Chapter. | Building on the earlier work of | mutualistas | , church groups, and community associations, the CSO stressed voter registration and held citizenship classes to promote political involvement. They also addressed ongoing problems such as poor community services and discrimination in housing, education, and employment. After WWII, Mexican American and African American civil rights groups occasionally worked together, though they sometimes differed in their aims and goals. For example, education was an important issue for both groups, but bilingual education was extremely important to Mexican Americans, while busing was a higher priority for African Americans. Fair housing and employment legislation were key issues for both, but Mexicans prioritized pensions for resident non-citizens, who were often not eligible for social services. | CSO members learned the importance of becoming activists in their own communities. By 1963, the CSO had 34 chapters across the Southwest, registering 500,000 new voters and helping over 50,000 Mexican immigrants obtain citizenship in California. In 1949, | utilizing the community organizing skills of Fred Ross, Sr., and CSO volunteers, Edward Roybal was elected to the Los Angeles City Council. The first Mexican to win a seat since 1881, Roybal was later elected to Congress, serving from 1963 to 1993. | Title:  Fred Ross, 1950s | Collections:  Fred Ross Papers | Source:  Special Collections, Greene Library, Stanford University Libraries, Stanford, CA | Additional Online Information | The Community Service Organization (CSO) | Guide to Community Service Organization History Project Records | César Chavez | Fred Ross - Zinn Education Project | Guide to the Fred Ross Papers | Meet the Long-Forgotten Organizer Who Inspired Cesar Chavez to Become an Activist | The Nation | The Formation of the San José Chapter of the CSO | In 1951 San José State College sociology professor and American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) member Claude Settles brought Fred Ross, Sr., to campus to give a lecture. Herman Gallegos, a student, and Leonard Ramirez and public health nurse Alicia Hernández, two community members, attended that lecture and encouraged Ross to organize a new CSO chapter in the | barrio | known as “Sal Sí Puedes | “ (meaning “Get Out if You Can,” a name that can be traced back to a Mexican land grant) in the Mayfair district of | East San José. | Assigned to a project in Kansas City, Ross reached out to his contacts in Santa Clara to provide local assistance and support. One of these was Quaker philanthropist and AFSC member Josephine Duveneck of Los Altos Hills. Duveneck initially provided housing for Fred Ross, Sr., a place to hold meetings, and financial support. In 1952 Ross was assigned by Saul Alinsky to work in San José, and shortly upon arrival, he sought out Father McDonnell to help identify potential organizers, such as Guadalupe-parish member César Chávez. | Ross’s community organizing techniques were based on door-to-door canvassing and house meetings. Volunteers such as Rita Chávez Medina (César’s sister), Herman Gallegos, and César Chávez went door-to-door in the Eastside’s crowded neighborhoods, over unpaved streets, registering voters and talking to residents about how to form a CSO Chapter. The community was ready, and the formational meeting took place at Mayfair Elementary School in 1952. Meetings were later moved to the Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel, where the CSO established its first offices, local campaigns were planned and organized, and volunteers were trained | . | Filename: FAIR USE_HSJ The Weekly Mayfair_Flooding East Side_Jan 17 1952_CROP_2006791.jpg | Objectid:  2006-79-1 | Caption: Mayfair_19520117_p01 | Owning Institution: History San Jose | Permalink: | https://historysanjose.pastperfectonline.com/media/947D46E1-8C99-4AA2-B387-450801468900 | The Founding Members of the CSO San José Chapter, Excluding Cesar Chavez | The following are some of the founding members of the CSO San José Chapter: | Herman Gallegos became the first president of the San José Chapter as well as president of the national CSO in 1960. Gallegos grew up in a poor coal-mining family who lived in a mud hut built by his father near the mines in Ludlow, Colorado, where he observed the infamous “Ludlow Massacre” of striking workers. After the massacre, the family moved to San Francisco. Gallegos first attended San Francisco State University, where  two of his professors, Dr. John Beecher and Dr. Herbert Bisno, refused to sign a loyalty oath required under the Levering Act affirming that the signer was an American and not a Communist or risk being fired. When a state police officer came into the classroom and handed Dr. Beecher a letter requiring him to leave, Gallegos and two Jewish students walked out of class and went to the administration office demanding the professor be reinstated. | Because the protesting students did not have a permit, the police broke up the protest, and Gallegos decided to transfer to the | Social Work Program at San José State College. | When he joined the CSO, he was attending college, living on the Eastside, and working as a gas station attendant. At that time he and Hernández were the only two members of the organization with a college education. In 1960 Gallegos became national CSO president, with César Chávez serving as executive director. | Alicia | Hernández, a public health nurse who worked with families on the Eastside, became a founding member after attending Fred Ross’ first talk at San José State College (with Herman Gallegos, Juan Marcoida, and Leonard Ramierez). She became the first temporary chair or interim president of the CSO San José chapter. A friend of Chávez’ wife Helen, Hernández arranged the first meeting between Ross and César Chávez, who was 25 years old. Hernández and Chávez walked door to door in the Eastside registering voters. | Juan Marcoida, another student who heard Ross’s initial talk at San José State, was an engineer who worked by day and went to college at night. He became a founding member of the CSO San José Chapter while working at the General Electric Plant, where he’d been employed since its opening in 1947. A resident of Sal Sí Puedes in the Eastside, Marcoida served two terms as president of the CSO San José Chapter. He also hosted a radio program called CSO INFORME that aired for ten years on KLOK and KSJO radio stations, highlighting jobs, legal issues, police brutality, domestic abuse, immigration, deportation, scams, and voter registration assistance. He was named “1956 Man of the Year” in | El Excentrico | magazine. | Rita Chávez Medina, the eldest of the Chávez siblings, had quit school at age 12 to help support the family after they lost their farm. She continued to work in the fields, transitioning into cannery work when she married and her family moved to San José. There she became active in local efforts to obtain a Catholic church to serve the Mexican community in the Eastside, enlisting the help of her brothers César and Richard, a union carpenter. She had already demonstrated her organizing skills in the church campaign when César asked her to work on the CSO voter registration drive, and he increasingly delegated local organizing tasks to her. Rita rose to become CSO San José Chapter President. | Leonard Ramirez, who also heard Ross’ speech, and his wife Erma became founding members of the CSO San José Chapter, fighting for paved streets and street lighting as well as promoting voter registration. Ramirez led the CSO drive to abolish citizenship requirements to receive Social Security benefits for old age. The law was revised in 1960 taking out Social Securities citizenship requirement. Ramirez was born in Watts, California, in 1926. After high school, he joined the army during WWII. Through the help of the GI Bill, he graduated from San José State College in 1953, one of only five Mexican students attending the university. | Filename: FAIR USE_HSJ The Weekly Mayfair_Flooding East Side_Jan 17 1952_CROP_2006791.jpg | Objectid:  2006-79-1 | Caption: Mayfair_19520117_p01 | Owning Institution: History San Jose | Permalink: | https://historysanjose.pastperfectonline.com/media/947D46E1-8C99-4AA2-B387-450801468900 | The Background, Recruitment and Rise of César Chávez to the CSO | César Chávez was born in 1927, the second of six children in an extended family of devout Catholics, and grew up on his grandparents’ family farm near Yuma, Arizona. In 1939, during the Depression, the farm was auctioned and sold to cover back taxes. César’s father had been diagnosed with a lung disease requiring a move to a cooler climate, and the family joined the growing number of American migrant workers in California. Unlike sister Rita, who quit school at 12 years of age to work in the fields full time, Césario (César) carried family expectations as the eldest boy and was allowed to attend school while working in the fields weekends and holidays. Eventually, he and his family worked across California from Brawley to Oxnard, Atascadero, Gonzales, King City, Salinas, McFarland, Delano, Wasco, Selma, Kingsburg, and Mendota. The essential injustice and underlying racism the family experienced during those years made a strong impression on César. Despite the numerous interruptions to his education, he graduated from the eighth grade in June 1942 and became a full-time farm laborer until he joined the Navy in 1945. | A Navy veteran by 1947, Chávez returned to working with the family as an agricultural laborer. He joined the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU), picking cotton in Corcoran, near Delano. Cesar and his brother Richard both worked briefly in the lumber yards of Crescent City. However, the distance was too far from the rest of the family in San José, so by the 1950s, their sister Rita encouraged César and Richard to relocate their families to San José. Richard became a successful union carpenter, and César continued working in the fields and local lumber yards when, at 25 years of age, he met Fred Ross, Sr., in 1952. | When Ross had begun to look for local organizers for the CSO, Alicia Hernández offered to introduce him to her friend Helen Chávez and her husband César, who had become active in social justice work through his association with Father McDonnell, pastor of the Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel. Through Fr. McDonnell, Chávez had learned the principles of nonviolent resistance and been introduced to Catholic teachings that emphasized social justice and challenged economic and social inequalities. With Father Mac, Chávez had visited labor camps and farmworkers living beyond the Eastside. | Fred Ross encouraged Chávez to become a full-time paid organizer for the Community Services Organization (CSO), and he soon began setting up chapters in the Bay Area and other towns across the state. Named executive director of the national CSO in 1959, Chávez moved to Los Angeles to work in the organization's main office. Though the CSO had become a successful advocate for communities of color, Chávez had not given up the idea of working with farmworkers and felt that the CSO was more focused on the problems of urban communities. In 1962 he left the CSO and moved to Delano, California, with his wife, their eight children, brother Richard Chávez, and Dolores Huerta, another CSO colleague from Stockton, in order to establish a union for farm laborers, the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) | Filename: FAIR USE_HSJ The Weekly Mayfair_Flooding East Side_Jan 17 1952_CROP_2006791.jpg | Objectid:  2006-79-1 | Caption: Mayfair_19520117_p01 | Owning Institution: History San Jose | Permalink: | https://historysanjose.pastperfectonline.com/media/947D46E1-8C99-4AA2-B387-450801468900 | Additional Online Information | Cesar Chavez Special Resource Study and Environmental Assessment | Padilla, Ruiz Introduce Legislation to Create the César E. Chávez and the Farmworker Movement National Park | César E. Chávez National Monument (U.S. National Park Service) | CSO San José Chapter Organizing Tactics | In San José, CSO organizers held house meetings where they identified community concerns, which became the focus of their campaigns, and recruited potential members and volunteers. Formal meetings were then held at the Mayfair School to create an official organization. The main issues of concern to Eastside residents included improving essential services, paving streets, installing streetlights, dealing with police brutality, and addressing economic inequality. Due to the anti-communist fervor of | the early 1950s, it was important to involve religious leaders like Fr. McDonnell to assure the authorities that CSO members were not Communists or political agitators, s | o the opportunity to hold regular meetings at the Chapel was welcomed. | Articles in | El Excentrico | introduced more people to the organization and emphasized its roots in the local community. Juan Marcoida, CSO member and chapter president, hosted a radio program, CSO INFORME, for ten years on KLOK and KSJO radio stations, with businesses donating to cover airtime costs. CSO services were provided free of charge, and, with so many people in need of help, fundraising was continuous–donated Christmas trees and tamales were sold, musicians played for free at dances, and members held raffles and ran a secondhand store. | Prior to World War II, only a small percentage of Mexican immigrants had filed naturalization papers since citizenship did not appear to improve their working or living conditions. CSO members learned that some problems required legislative remedies to develop better public policy, which made citizenship, and thus citizenship classes, more important. The CSO became part of a civil-rights coalition, including the NAACP, the Urban League, the Jewish Community Relations Committee, the Japanese American Citizens League, and other organizations that met regularly to frame the strategy for public policy involvement in California. By increasing their political power through citizenship classes and voter registration, these groups fought discrimination in education, housing, and employment on local and state levels. In the 1950s, the CSO San José Chapter lobbied to end citizenship requirements for Social Security benefits and promoted voter registration drives with the assistance of the G.I. Forum and worked with the NAACP to challenge discrimination of Mexicans against African Americans. | Filename: FAIR USE_HSJ The Weekly Mayfair_Flooding East Side_Jan 17 1952_CROP_2006791.jpg | Objectid:  2006-79-1 | Caption: Mayfair_19520117_p01 | Owning Institution: History San Jose | Permalink: | https://historysanjose.pastperfectonline.com/media/947D46E1-8C99-4AA2-B387-450801468900 | Life After the CSO:  Some of the Founding Leaders of the San José Chapter | Alicia Hernandez, who did not like being in the spotlight that can accompany a leadership role, moved to San Francisco to continue nursing. | Leonard Ramierez became a probation officer and helped to open the James Ranch Juvenile facility in Morgan Hill (William F. James Boys Ranch). He became chair of the United Way of Santa Clara County, a founder of the Hispanic Development Corporation, and a member of the GI Forum. | After leaving the CSO in the early 1960s, Fred Ross helped organize residents of Guadalupe, Arizona, primarily Mexican Americans and Yaqui Indians, to gain basic services such as paved roads and stop signs. He then taught organizing skills to students at Syracuse University working on a campaign, supported by federal “War on Poverty'' funds, to organize African American residents living in dilapidated public housing. The idea of paying organizers with government funds to stir up people to challenge government policies proved controversial, and the funding was eventually halted. Returning to California in 1966, Ross became the organizing director of the United | Farm Workers Association | .  He assisted the UFW in a campaign over who would represent workers at DiGiorgio, a major grower in the San Joaquin Valley. He would spend the late 1960s and 70s assisting Chávez and the UFW with various elections and boycotts, training thousands of UFW volunteers in his organizing methods. Well into the 1980s, he trained a number of groups working on a broad range of issues, from U.S. intervention in Central America to nuclear disarmament. One of his favorite axioms described the role of the organizer: “A good organizer is a social arsonist who goes around setting people on fire.” | Recruited by Saul Alinsky to become a full-time organizer, Herman Gallegos decided to pursue his career in social work and received his Masters in Social Work (MSW) from U.C. Berkeley, becoming an advocate for Chicano youth and active in the local CSO. After graduation, Gallegos worked as a district director with the San Bernardino County Council of Community Services, a social planning demonstration project supported by the Rosenberg Foundation. | In 1965, Gallegos | , Dr. Ernesto Galarza, and Dr. Julian Samora were recruited by the Ford Foundation to | serve as national affairs consultants. The group explored potential  philanthropic support, making recommendations and identifying solutions to address the growing needs of Latino communities. | Gallegos went on to become executive director of the National Council of La Raza in 1968, co-founder of Hispanics in Philanthropy, and a U.S. public delegate to the 49th General Assembly of the United Nations. | César Chávez left the CSO because of its emphasis on urban social justice issues. In 1962 he and Dolores Huerta co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (later the United Farm Workers of | America | ). Chávez believed i | t was important that the new union succeed through nonviolent tactics (boycotts, pickets, and strikes). Although Chávez’s methods as an organizer and labor leader were sometimes controversial, the movement he led brought farmworkers dignity and self-respect, as well as better wages and working conditions. In California, he pushed through what remains today the most pro-labor law in the country, the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, granting farm workers the right to organize and petition for union elections. As stated in the César Chávez Special Resource Study, issued by the National Park Service in 2012: “César Chávez is recognized for his achievements as the charismatic leader of the farm labor movement and the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), the first permanent agricultural labor union in the history of the United States. The most important Latino leader in the U.S. during the twentieth century, Chávez emerged as a civil rights leader among Latinos during the 1950s. Moreover, Chávez and the UFW sought to inspire all men and women to respect the dignity of labor, the importance of community, and the power of peaceful protest.“ | The legacy of these organizers from an earlier time can be seen in the work of a generation of activists and community organizers who joined the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s and '70s, transforming their lives and inspiring the activism that continues through today."}

Increased mechanization and more efficient processes gradually replaced most of the hand labor in the canneries. The construction of new packing houses and canneries west of the Guadalupe River, north of Jackson, and south of Keyes Street drew migrant ethnic Mexican laborers into those areas of San José. | Early promoters called San José “The Garden City.” To take advantage of bumper crop years, keep their product fresh after the season, and utilize distant markets, orchard ranchers preserved their fruit through canning and drying. In 1871 at his home on The Alameda, Dr. James Dawson, a local doctor/fruit grower, formed Dawson & Company, which | In 1875 was renamed the San Jose Fruit Packing Company (SJFPCO), located at the corner of Fifth and Julian Streets. In 1893 the company, relocated to the west side of the Guadalupe River south of Auzerais Street, was the largest cannery in the world. By 1900 canned food production had become the second largest industry in California, with Santa Clara County in the lead. During the 1930s, 38 canneries hiring up to 30,000 people at peak season operated in the county, several run by huge corporations such as Libby’s, Hunt’s, Richmond-Chase, and Calpak. | Commercial sales of fruit increased with the construction of the San Jose Fruit Packing Company | facility | in 1875. Workers at the first canneries included local residents and  seasonal migrants. Some employers offered company housing for skilled workers, though individually rented boarding house rooms and hotel rooms were more typical. Worker neighborhoods with small family homes soon appeared adjacent to packing houses and canneries. | San José's Eastside grew after the Mayfair Fruit Packing Company was constructed in 1944, in the largely Mexican neighborhood known as | t | he Mayfair district. | 1  of | 12 | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Formation of Producer Exchanges in Santa Clara County | Canners and growers formed producer exchanges or cooperatives in which groups of farmers producing the same type of crop collaborated to negotiate prices, hire labor, and access larger markets. In agriculture, these exchanges were characterized by ”horizontal integration,” in which companies of the same industry band together for harvesting, processing, and selling. Just as in Southern California citrus, Santa Clara County canners and growers formed a producer exchange in 1899. San José Fruit Packing Company (SJFPC) joined with seventeen other companies (including half of the canning establishments in California) to form the California Fruit Canners’ Association (CFCA), which eventually operated 28 fruit and vegetable canneries through the state and acquired operations in four other states. Within four years, CFCA was the world’s leader in fruit and vegetable canning and drying. By 1916 the CFCA had merged with five other canneries to form California Packing Corporation (CalPak), developing into the Del Monte Brand, the first national company in the United States, offering 50 products. | Cannery operations were large facilities, with warehouses, processing facilities, railyards, garages, shops, and offices, employing several hundred to several thousand people. As a regional hub for the food processing industry, local canneries received produce not only from the Bay area but from much of Northern and Central California. Historian Glenna Matthews states that by the 1930s Calpak was the largest canner in California and Santa Clara County had become the fruit processing capital of the world.

Jobs were clearly divided along gender, ethnic, and racial lines. Chinese men, Mexican | Californio | women and men, and Anglo men and women filled the first cannery jobs when the canneries during the 1870s and 1880s.  Following the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish immigrants soon dominated the Santa Clara County cannery labor force into WWII. | By the 1930s, Santa Clara County’s 38 canneries were the largest employers of women in California. Historian Glenna Matthews divides these canneries into three categories: the large corporate canners of Libby’s, Hunt’s, or Calpak; the smaller joint firms such as Richmond-Chase (2,073 peak season workers); and the marginal single canneries, including Garden City Canning Company (197 peak season workers). | In the 1930s, white ethnic women had risen to supervisory positions as floor ladies, with full authority over subordinates. During WWII, many of these women moved to better paying positions in defense industries and jobs vacated by men. By the mid-1940s, the percentage of women in the American workforce had expanded from 25 to 36 percent. With the wartime labor shortages, more Mexican women were recruited to work in the canneries. | 3  of | 12 | Title: Richmond Chase Canning Plant No. 4 | Date: Circa 1927 | No: ECS4192 | Collection:  Edith C.

Over half of Santa Clara County canning production was allocated for the war effort.  Meanwhile, canneries in San José suffered labor shortages because of the absence of men to the military and the shift of ethnic white women to higher-paying, year-round “Rosie the Riveter” manufacturing jobs, such as at Hendy Iron Works. | In response, Mexican women and | braceros | filled cannery jobs. During peak periods, canneries operated non-stop, and many provided transportation during the night shift or allowed women to work until 6:00 a.m., when public buses began to operate. | From 1948 to the 1970s, among cannery women workers,  Mexicans comprised the largest ethnic group, with Mexican women working on the line under the supervision of older Italian and Portuguese women, while Mexican men worked in the higher-paying year-round warehouse jobs. Second-generation, English-speaking Mexican American women moved easily from the cannery line to higher- paying supervisory positions and front-office jobs. | 4  of | 12 | Title:  Female Cannery Employees on Assembly Line Preparing Pears for Canning | Date: c. 1940 | Photographer: John C.

Large canneries with access to produce from other regions might shift from one product to another, operating year-round. During harvest season, canneries operated around the clock, with three shifts of workers per day. While some workers returned annually, new employees were hired seasonally through “shape-ups,” an informal selection process in which workers gathered in front of the office hoping to be hired at the cannery. Due to the large number of canneries and packing houses in the county, workers usually had several opportunities to find work nearby. During labor shortages, canneries in Santa Clara County advertised in Bay Area newspapers to ensure at least a minimum number of applicants. | Having a connection in the cannery workforce–friends or family–often resulted in a hiring preference, and these ties were also helpful on the job as experienced workers provided support and instruction to newcomers. Because employment was seasonal, workers maximized income while jobs were available, working daily and often overtime. This might mean hiding a pregnancy (because pregnant women were not hired), working when sick, or staying on the job even after an injury. Workers wanted to make sure that they would be asked to return for the next season. | 5  of | 12 | Title: Eastside Plant | Date: c. 1945 | Photographer:  John Leonard | Collection: History San José Silicon Valley History Online Collection | Source:  Calisphere | Gender Division in Cannery Work | In the canneries up until the 1970s with the implementation of the 1960s Civil Rights legislation, men held year-round jobs in shipping and warehouses, with women assigned to “semi-skilled” seasonal assembly-line hand labor–peeling, cutting, and slicing–standing at work stations all day except for lunch and breaks.  Most women were assigned to processing operations or “women’s department.” The monotony and boredom of assembly-line work was a strain, unlike men’s jobs, which allowed for more independence. Cook-room, labeling, stacking, and boxing machines were generally operated by men, who also managed the storage and shipping warehouses. Under the assumption that they were better suited for physical labor and were supporting families, men were assigned to the higher-paying work of supervising, heavy lifting, and equipment operation and maintenance. Full-time jobs provided higher wages and opportunities for advancement, along with a degree of autonomy. | Due to these gendered job categories, women also suffered from limited opportunities for advancement. Not until the 1970s, after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, would they move into higher-paying, year-round jobs traditionally reserved for men. | 6  of | 12 | Title:  Assembling Fruit Crates | Date: c. 1930 | Photographer: John C.

Prior to that time, line supervisors were typically Italian or Portuguese, while crews were overwhelmingly Mexican. Supervisors held a degree of authority and could dismiss workers at will. Forewomen circulated the shop floor, enforcing rules, instructing workers, and pushing for faster, more accurate work. Most importantly, forewomen had complete discretion in assigning workers. | While ethnic white women might do the same jobs as Mexican women, they were often segregated by their supervisors, who sometimes helped members of their own group secure better jobs. Combined with the language barrier, Mexican women found little basis for solidarity with these co-workers and sometimes perceived comments from supervisors as racially biased. In addition, although they all might speak Spanish, relations between American-born Mexicans and Mexican immigrants could sometimes be strained. | 7  of | 12 | Title: Women at Work Inside Cannery | Description: Interior of cannery showing women standing at their | stations.

Since little job training was provided, family members could offer advice on the use of equipment as well as how to work with supervisors. Lunching together, sharing babysitting, or traveling to work with family members strengthened kinship networks, and new friendships developed with people they may not have met outside the cannery.   Unlike the men who worked in shipping, warehousing, or as equipment operators, before 1970, women did not view cannery jobs as a permanent occupation because there were few opportunities for training and advancement. | Women workers, no matter their background, shared mutual concerns about wages, working conditions, and poor supervisors. There was no time to socialize while on the assembly line or during brief breaks, and the noise made it hard to converse. In the 1930s, shared concerns over workplace safety and low wages led some Mexican women to become involved in union organizing efforts, including strikes, and to rely on social networks for support. “Women’s cannery work culture” made the daily routine easier because women shared their experiences, helping each other adjust to the challenges of the workplace. | 8  of | 12 | Title:  Cannery Women Posing | Date: c. 1950s | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, Herminia and Leandro Villareal Family Collection | Source:  Special Collections, SJSU | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | Women's Work and Chicano Families: Cannery Workers of the Santa Clara Valley on JSTOR | Women's Work and Chicano Families | 9 A Promise Fulfilled Mexican Cannery Workers in Southern California | A Day on the Cannery Assembly Line | By the 1950s, many operations formerly done by hand were now at least partially performed by machines. Fruit arriving at the cannery, such as peaches, was dumped onto “shakers”; then onto the conveyor belt for cleaning, washing, pitting, and halving by machine; and finally sorted into grades by hand. A few women supervisors oversaw this female-dominated task. | On the floor, workers stood at their stations sorting fruit as it came down the conveyor. Cans on conveyors filed by the seam-inspectors, and women “checkers” sealed the cans before they were loaded into cookers. Women concentrated on doing their jobs quickly in order to meet required quotas.  Processing areas were noisy, with the constant clamor of machinery and cans running along conveyor belts. Chemicals such as lye and chlorine were used to wash and clean the fruit. Some women who worked in steaming and canning spinach complained of their nails falling off due to prolonged submersion into the spinach vats.  Fruit and vegetable processing required a great deal of handwork to sort, weigh, and fill cans with sometimes steaming hot produce. Once canned, some women looked for dented cans before they were boxed up.  The work was demanding and exhausting, constantly proceeding at a pace set by the conveyor belt. When the women got home, their bodies smelled like the fruit or vegetable in which they worked all day, particularly tomatoes.  It was difficult to get adequate rest.   Many women cannery workers complained about hearing the clanking of the machines even in their sleep. | By the 1940s, shifts usually lasted eight hours but could be longer during peak harvest periods, when some canneries operated on a 24-hour schedule. Companies facing labor shortages encouraged regular employees to work overtime, and despite the demands of the job, many welcomed​​ the opportunity to earn extra money. | 9  of | 12 | Title:  Women Packing Peach Halves | Description: Woman filling jars with peach halves at California Packing Corporation’s Plant #3 located at 801 Auzerais Ave. in San José.  The very earliest canning enterprises used glass jars, but by the 1890s the industry had adapted to tin cans.  In the 1930s, glass jars were reintroduced and marketed as a premium product.  Notice the scales to her left and right-each filled jar was weighed for accuracy.  The worker wears a uniform, apron, cap and gloves provided by the California Packing Corporation.  California Packing Corporation sold its products under a number of proprietary and distributive labels, including their premium brand, Del Monte.  In June 1967, the company name was officially changed to the Del Monte Corporation. | Date: 1949 | Photographer:  Moulin Studio | Catalog No: 1997-224-189 | Collection:  History San José Photographic Collection | Source:  Calisphere | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Cannery Injuries and Hazards | Before the 1930s, workdays for women cannery workers could be up to 18 hours, or 96 hours a week. Historian Glenna Matthews notes that in 1913 the Industrial Welfare Commission was formed to protect laboring women and children but excluded workers in “perishable materials” such as cannery workers. | A high percentage of women working in canneries at that time were immigrants who spoke limited English, so receiving adequate training was difficult, and safety instructions were printed only in English. Assembly-line labor was repetitive, and women stood at their stations for hours working with their hands in acidic fruit. Many women reported severe damage to their hands  and fingers from operating swiftly-running machinery. Many reported severe damage to their hands, not from traumatic injuries but from nicks and cuts received while cutting fruit by hand. As cans rattled along conveyors in buildings that were sometimes the size of four football fields, noise was also a constant problem. Industrial chemicals were hard on the skin and a hazard to eyes and lungs. At the peak of the season, workers might put in ten hours a day, six days a week, leaving them exhausted and dehydrated at the end of their shift. | Women continued to bring health and safety concerns to management and their unions. During and after WWII, some larger canneries, such as Del Monte, created an infirmary with a nurse near the processing line. While conditions generally improved over time, anthropologist Patricia Zavella, in her book | Women’s Work and Chicano Families | , noted that in 1978, canneries were still considered one of the most dangerous industries, second only to lumber manufacturing according to the U.S. Department of Labor. | 10  of | 12 | Title: Cannery Workers at Conveyor Belts, Tri-Valley Cannery | Description: Busy cannery floor with women standing at conveyor belts loaded with cut pears.  Handwritten note accompany photo ready, “Sorting and trim belts in “Preparation” area - after pear machines in background.

Still, most considered cannery work a better alternative than field or orchard jobs. Working seasonally enabled them to supplement the family income or serve as the breadwinner when husbands were unemployed, while maintaining their primary roles as wives and mothers. | A major challenge for cannery women was finding appropriate and affordable childcare. During the 1940s and 1950s, CalPak operated a nursery at the Del Monte Plant #3, providing childcare during the day and second shift. However, as childcare was unavailable at most canneries, mothers left their children with family members or neighbors, while others paid for babysitters or bartered for care with co-workers. Husbands and wives who worked at the same plant might arrange complicated shift schedules. | Working mothers believed that, in easing their husbands’ responsibility as providers, they could ask for more assistance with housework. However, men often found it difficult to participate in many of these domestic chores, so cooking and childcare were often handled by older children. | Women cannery workers knew that their paychecks enabled them to provide more assistance to their children, send their kids to college, allow their husbands to attend trade school, start their own business, or have a higher standard of living, and they wanted a say in how household money would be spent. Women made time to do the necessary household chores by extending their day, staying up late or waking early. | 11  of | 12 | Title:  Community Workers at Santa Clara Valley Growers | Date:  c. 1935 | Photographer: Unknown | No: 00482 | Collection:  Sourisseau Academy Collection | Source:  Sourisseau Academy, SJSU Library | Cannery Decline | At the height of the fruit season during WWII, canneries operated seven days a week with shifts as long as eleven or twelve hours per day. After World War II, demand for canned fruit rapidly declined, leaving owners holding large loans that had been taken out to expand productivity. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, orchards and fields were being replaced by business and research parks and housing developments, creating the emerging Silicon Valley. Changes occurred also when the Teamsters Union took cannery representation away from the AFL, and when Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1967) required that jobs could not be classified as “male” or “female” work. By 1976, because most cannery jobs were unionized, women were receiving wage, medical, holiday, and retirement benefits. Although their benefits were still lower than men’s, women found cannery work offered stability, allowing many to become homeowners. | When fruit processing operations began to decline in the 1970s, the growth of manufacturing in the electronics industry and new housing tracts provided opportunities for displaced workers in construction, railroads, warehouse, and assembly work. Unfortunately, these new jobs were not comparable to the higher-wage union jobs in the canning industry. For many workers, the cannery closures meant the end of secure jobs with benefits and the long-term working relationships they had created. By 1987, only eight canneries existed in the valley, the era ended when, in 1999, Del Monte closed its largest cannery, Plant #3, the site of the 1893 San Jose Fruit Packing Company. | 12  of | 12 | Title:  Frances Pacheco Wells, Interviewed by Joe Rivera and Margo McBane, Ph.D., Videographer Rick Romero, Del Monte Plant #3 after move. | Photographer: Onawa Foster Virostko | Date:  1996 | Collection: Francis Pacheco Wells Oral History, Del Monte Oral History Collection | Source: History San José | Additional Online Information | Del Monte Cannery Last Day | Previous | Next | The History of Cannery Development in Santa Clara County | Following early experimentation with horticulture, the canning industry was established in 1872.  Aided by an expanded railroad system and access to broader markets, Santa Clara County became the capital for fruit processing/canning.  In 1920, the county produced 90% of California’s canned fruits and vegetables, a share that continued into the 1950s. Increased mechanization and more efficient processes gradually replaced most of the hand labor in the canneries. The construction of new packing houses and canneries west of the Guadalupe River, north of Jackson, and south of Keyes Street drew migrant ethnic Mexican laborers into those areas of San José. | Early promoters called San José “The Garden City.” To take advantage of bumper crop years, keep their product fresh after the season, and utilize distant markets, orchard ranchers preserved their fruit through canning and drying. In 1871 at his home on The Alameda, Dr. James Dawson, a local doctor/fruit grower, formed Dawson & Company, which | In 1875 was renamed the San Jose Fruit Packing Company (SJFPCO), located at the corner of Fifth and Julian Streets. In 1893 the company, relocated to the west side of the Guadalupe River south of Auzerais Street, was the largest cannery in the world. By 1900 canned food production had become the second largest industry in California, with Santa Clara County in the lead. During the 1930s, 38 canneries hiring up to 30,000 people at peak season operated in the county, several run by huge corporations such as Libby’s, Hunt’s, Richmond-Chase, and Calpak. | Commercial sales of fruit increased with the construction of the San Jose Fruit Packing Company | facility | in 1875. Workers at the first canneries included local residents and  seasonal migrants. Some employers offered company housing for skilled workers, though individually rented boarding house rooms and hotel rooms were more typical. Worker neighborhoods with small family homes soon appeared adjacent to packing houses and canneries. | San José's Eastside grew after the Mayfair Fruit Packing Company was constructed in 1944, in the largely Mexican neighborhood known as | t | he Mayfair district. | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Formation of Producer Exchanges in Santa Clara County | Canners and growers formed producer exchanges or cooperatives in which groups of farmers producing the same type of crop collaborated to negotiate prices, hire labor, and access larger markets. In agriculture, these exchanges were characterized by ”horizontal integration,” in which companies of the same industry band together for harvesting, processing, and selling. Just as in Southern California citrus, Santa Clara County canners and growers formed a producer exchange in 1899. San José Fruit Packing Company (SJFPC) joined with seventeen other companies (including half of the canning establishments in California) to form the California Fruit Canners’ Association (CFCA), which eventually operated 28 fruit and vegetable canneries through the state and acquired operations in four other states. Within four years, CFCA was the world’s leader in fruit and vegetable canning and drying. By 1916 the CFCA had merged with five other canneries to form California Packing Corporation (CalPak), developing into the Del Monte Brand, the first national company in the United States, offering 50 products. | Cannery operations were large facilities, with warehouses, processing facilities, railyards, garages, shops, and offices, employing several hundred to several thousand people. As a regional hub for the food processing industry, local canneries received produce not only from the Bay area but from much of Northern and Central California. Historian Glenna Matthews states that by the 1930s Calpak was the largest canner in California and Santa Clara County had become the fruit processing capital of the world.

Smith Collection | Source:  Sourisseau Academy, SJSU Library | Additional Online Information | Del Monte Packing Plant History | Women Dominate the Ethnic White Cannery Labor Force Pre-WWII | Canneries are labor-intensive operations, and the labor force required to serve this expanding industry grew with the increase of orchards under production. Jobs were clearly divided along gender, ethnic, and racial lines. Chinese men, Mexican | Californio | women and men, and Anglo men and women filled the first cannery jobs when the canneries during the 1870s and 1880s.  Following the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish immigrants soon dominated the Santa Clara County cannery labor force into WWII. | By the 1930s, Santa Clara County’s 38 canneries were the largest employers of women in California. Historian Glenna Matthews divides these canneries into three categories: the large corporate canners of Libby’s, Hunt’s, or Calpak; the smaller joint firms such as Richmond-Chase (2,073 peak season workers); and the marginal single canneries, including Garden City Canning Company (197 peak season workers). | In the 1930s, white ethnic women had risen to supervisory positions as floor ladies, with full authority over subordinates. During WWII, many of these women moved to better paying positions in defense industries and jobs vacated by men. By the mid-1940s, the percentage of women in the American workforce had expanded from 25 to 36 percent. With the wartime labor shortages, more Mexican women were recruited to work in the canneries. | Title: Richmond Chase Canning Plant No. 4 | Date: Circa 1927 | No: ECS4192 | Collection:  Edith C.

Over half of Santa Clara County canning production was allocated for the war effort.  Meanwhile, canneries in San José suffered labor shortages because of the absence of men to the military and the shift of ethnic white women to higher-paying, year-round “Rosie the Riveter” manufacturing jobs, such as at Hendy Iron Works. | In response, Mexican women and | braceros | filled cannery jobs. During peak periods, canneries operated non-stop, and many provided transportation during the night shift or allowed women to work until 6:00 a.m., when public buses began to operate. | From 1948 to the 1970s, among cannery women workers,  Mexicans comprised the largest ethnic group, with Mexican women working on the line under the supervision of older Italian and Portuguese women, while Mexican men worked in the higher-paying year-round warehouse jobs. Second-generation, English-speaking Mexican American women moved easily from the cannery line to higher- paying supervisory positions and front-office jobs. | Title:  Female Cannery Employees on Assembly Line Preparing Pears for Canning | Date: c. 1940 | Photographer: John C.

Large canneries with access to produce from other regions might shift from one product to another, operating year-round. During harvest season, canneries operated around the clock, with three shifts of workers per day. While some workers returned annually, new employees were hired seasonally through “shape-ups,” an informal selection process in which workers gathered in front of the office hoping to be hired at the cannery. Due to the large number of canneries and packing houses in the county, workers usually had several opportunities to find work nearby. During labor shortages, canneries in Santa Clara County advertised in Bay Area newspapers to ensure at least a minimum number of applicants. | Having a connection in the cannery workforce–friends or family–often resulted in a hiring preference, and these ties were also helpful on the job as experienced workers provided support and instruction to newcomers. Because employment was seasonal, workers maximized income while jobs were available, working daily and often overtime. This might mean hiding a pregnancy (because pregnant women were not hired), working when sick, or staying on the job even after an injury. Workers wanted to make sure that they would be asked to return for the next season. | Title: Eastside Plant | Date: c. 1945 | Photographer:  John Leonard | Collection: History San José Silicon Valley History Online Collection | Source:  Calisphere | Gender Division in Cannery Work | In the canneries up until the 1970s with the implementation of the 1960s Civil Rights legislation, men held year-round jobs in shipping and warehouses, with women assigned to “semi-skilled” seasonal assembly-line hand labor–peeling, cutting, and slicing–standing at work stations all day except for lunch and breaks.  Most women were assigned to processing operations or “women’s department.” The monotony and boredom of assembly-line work was a strain, unlike men’s jobs, which allowed for more independence. Cook-room, labeling, stacking, and boxing machines were generally operated by men, who also managed the storage and shipping warehouses. Under the assumption that they were better suited for physical labor and were supporting families, men were assigned to the higher-paying work of supervising, heavy lifting, and equipment operation and maintenance. Full-time jobs provided higher wages and opportunities for advancement, along with a degree of autonomy. | Due to these gendered job categories, women also suffered from limited opportunities for advancement. Not until the 1970s, after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, would they move into higher-paying, year-round jobs traditionally reserved for men. | Title:  Assembling Fruit Crates | Date: c. 1930 | Photographer: John C.

Prior to that time, line supervisors were typically Italian or Portuguese, while crews were overwhelmingly Mexican. Supervisors held a degree of authority and could dismiss workers at will. Forewomen circulated the shop floor, enforcing rules, instructing workers, and pushing for faster, more accurate work. Most importantly, forewomen had complete discretion in assigning workers. | While ethnic white women might do the same jobs as Mexican women, they were often segregated by their supervisors, who sometimes helped members of their own group secure better jobs. Combined with the language barrier, Mexican women found little basis for solidarity with these co-workers and sometimes perceived comments from supervisors as racially biased. In addition, although they all might speak Spanish, relations between American-born Mexicans and Mexican immigrants could sometimes be strained. | Title: Women at Work Inside Cannery | Description: Interior of cannery showing women standing at their | stations.

Since little job training was provided, family members could offer advice on the use of equipment as well as how to work with supervisors. Lunching together, sharing babysitting, or traveling to work with family members strengthened kinship networks, and new friendships developed with people they may not have met outside the cannery.   Unlike the men who worked in shipping, warehousing, or as equipment operators, before 1970, women did not view cannery jobs as a permanent occupation because there were few opportunities for training and advancement. | Women workers, no matter their background, shared mutual concerns about wages, working conditions, and poor supervisors. There was no time to socialize while on the assembly line or during brief breaks, and the noise made it hard to converse. In the 1930s, shared concerns over workplace safety and low wages led some Mexican women to become involved in union organizing efforts, including strikes, and to rely on social networks for support. “Women’s cannery work culture” made the daily routine easier because women shared their experiences, helping each other adjust to the challenges of the workplace. | Title:  Cannery Women Posing | Date: c. 1950s | Collection: Before Silicon Valley Project Archive, Herminia and Leandro Villareal Family Collection | Source:  Special Collections, SJSU | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | Women's Work and Chicano Families: Cannery Workers of the Santa Clara Valley on JSTOR | Women's Work and Chicano Families | 9 A Promise Fulfilled Mexican Cannery Workers in Southern California | A Day on the Cannery Assembly Line | By the 1950s, many operations formerly done by hand were now at least partially performed by machines. Fruit arriving at the cannery, such as peaches, was dumped onto “shakers”; then onto the conveyor belt for cleaning, washing, pitting, and halving by machine; and finally sorted into grades by hand. A few women supervisors oversaw this female-dominated task. | On the floor, workers stood at their stations sorting fruit as it came down the conveyor. Cans on conveyors filed by the seam-inspectors, and women “checkers” sealed the cans before they were loaded into cookers. Women concentrated on doing their jobs quickly in order to meet required quotas.  Processing areas were noisy, with the constant clamor of machinery and cans running along conveyor belts. Chemicals such as lye and chlorine were used to wash and clean the fruit. Some women who worked in steaming and canning spinach complained of their nails falling off due to prolonged submersion into the spinach vats.  Fruit and vegetable processing required a great deal of handwork to sort, weigh, and fill cans with sometimes steaming hot produce. Once canned, some women looked for dented cans before they were boxed up.  The work was demanding and exhausting, constantly proceeding at a pace set by the conveyor belt. When the women got home, their bodies smelled like the fruit or vegetable in which they worked all day, particularly tomatoes.  It was difficult to get adequate rest.   Many women cannery workers complained about hearing the clanking of the machines even in their sleep. | By the 1940s, shifts usually lasted eight hours but could be longer during peak harvest periods, when some canneries operated on a 24-hour schedule. Companies facing labor shortages encouraged regular employees to work overtime, and despite the demands of the job, many welcomed​​ the opportunity to earn extra money. | Title:  Women Packing Peach Halves | Description: Woman filling jars with peach halves at California Packing Corporation’s Plant #3 located at 801 Auzerais Ave. in San José.  The very earliest canning enterprises used glass jars, but by the 1890s the industry had adapted to tin cans.  In the 1930s, glass jars were reintroduced and marketed as a premium product.  Notice the scales to her left and right-each filled jar was weighed for accuracy.  The worker wears a uniform, apron, cap and gloves provided by the California Packing Corporation.  California Packing Corporation sold its products under a number of proprietary and distributive labels, including their premium brand, Del Monte.  In June 1967, the company name was officially changed to the Del Monte Corporation. | Date: 1949 | Photographer:  Moulin Studio | Catalog No: 1997-224-189 | Collection:  History San José Photographic Collection | Source:  Calisphere | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Cannery Injuries and Hazards | Before the 1930s, workdays for women cannery workers could be up to 18 hours, or 96 hours a week. Historian Glenna Matthews notes that in 1913 the Industrial Welfare Commission was formed to protect laboring women and children but excluded workers in “perishable materials” such as cannery workers. | A high percentage of women working in canneries at that time were immigrants who spoke limited English, so receiving adequate training was difficult, and safety instructions were printed only in English. Assembly-line labor was repetitive, and women stood at their stations for hours working with their hands in acidic fruit. Many women reported severe damage to their hands  and fingers from operating swiftly-running machinery. Many reported severe damage to their hands, not from traumatic injuries but from nicks and cuts received while cutting fruit by hand. As cans rattled along conveyors in buildings that were sometimes the size of four football fields, noise was also a constant problem. Industrial chemicals were hard on the skin and a hazard to eyes and lungs. At the peak of the season, workers might put in ten hours a day, six days a week, leaving them exhausted and dehydrated at the end of their shift. | Women continued to bring health and safety concerns to management and their unions. During and after WWII, some larger canneries, such as Del Monte, created an infirmary with a nurse near the processing line. While conditions generally improved over time, anthropologist Patricia Zavella, in her book | Women’s Work and Chicano Families | , noted that in 1978, canneries were still considered one of the most dangerous industries, second only to lumber manufacturing according to the U.S. Department of Labor. | Title: Cannery Workers at Conveyor Belts, Tri-Valley Cannery | Description: Busy cannery floor with women standing at conveyor belts loaded with cut pears.  Handwritten note accompany photo ready, “Sorting and trim belts in “Preparation” area - after pear machines in background.

Still, most considered cannery work a better alternative than field or orchard jobs. Working seasonally enabled them to supplement the family income or serve as the breadwinner when husbands were unemployed, while maintaining their primary roles as wives and mothers. | A major challenge for cannery women was finding appropriate and affordable childcare. During the 1940s and 1950s, CalPak operated a nursery at the Del Monte Plant #3, providing childcare during the day and second shift. However, as childcare was unavailable at most canneries, mothers left their children with family members or neighbors, while others paid for babysitters or bartered for care with co-workers. Husbands and wives who worked at the same plant might arrange complicated shift schedules. | Working mothers believed that, in easing their husbands’ responsibility as providers, they could ask for more assistance with housework. However, men often found it difficult to participate in many of these domestic chores, so cooking and childcare were often handled by older children. | Women cannery workers knew that their paychecks enabled them to provide more assistance to their children, send their kids to college, allow their husbands to attend trade school, start their own business, or have a higher standard of living, and they wanted a say in how household money would be spent. Women made time to do the necessary household chores by extending their day, staying up late or waking early. | Title:  Community Workers at Santa Clara Valley Growers | Date:  c. 1935 | Photographer: Unknown | No: 00482 | Collection:  Sourisseau Academy Collection | Source:  Sourisseau Academy, SJSU Library | Cannery Decline | At the height of the fruit season during WWII, canneries operated seven days a week with shifts as long as eleven or twelve hours per day. After World War II, demand for canned fruit rapidly declined, leaving owners holding large loans that had been taken out to expand productivity. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, orchards and fields were being replaced by business and research parks and housing developments, creating the emerging Silicon Valley. Changes occurred also when the Teamsters Union took cannery representation away from the AFL, and when Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1967) required that jobs could not be classified as “male” or “female” work. By 1976, because most cannery jobs were unionized, women were receiving wage, medical, holiday, and retirement benefits. Although their benefits were still lower than men’s, women found cannery work offered stability, allowing many to become homeowners. | When fruit processing operations began to decline in the 1970s, the growth of manufacturing in the electronics industry and new housing tracts provided opportunities for displaced workers in construction, railroads, warehouse, and assembly work.

During the Mexican Period of 1821-1848, the Catholic Church lost most of its land holdings in Alta California except for property surrounding church buildings. After secularization in 1833, a wholesale transfer of land grants to the | Californios | (la gente de razon– | the Christianized residents) took place. Ranchos employed between twenty and several hundred laborers. The original plan to grant the land to the converted Indians was never implemented. A social system of seigneurialism took hold in which | Californio | rancheros | , the land owners, and their mestizo and Indio laborers lived in a world of mutual obligation. In this paternal system, | rancheros | provided housing, food, and clothing to workers in exchange for their labor. | During the combined Spanish and Mexican rancho periods, 500 land grants were issued, with the majority (450) carved from mission land holdings after secularization. Mexico’s 1824 Law of Colonization specified that the maximum land grant could be 48,400 acres, with the average being 22,000 acres. No longer restricted to trading only with Spanish galleons, Mexicans began engaging in “the hide and tallow trade” internationally. Mexican hides, known as “California dollars,” were used to make shoes, leather belts, and other items, helping  propel the United States’ early industrial revolution of the 1820s and 1830s. | 7  of | 17 | Title: Painting of a Spanish Rancho Cattle Round-up | Date: circa 1840/1880 | Collection: California Historical Society Collection, 1860-1960 | Owning Institution: California Historical Society | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/3460d549a830ef1092735174158b52eb/ | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | Mexican California | Library of Congress | Land Grants in Alta California | Battle of Santa Clara - Clio | Californio Society — Calisphere | Witness to Empire: The Life of Antonio Maria Sunol | Americans During the Mexican Period, 1810s-1840s | Anglo Americans first began settling in Alta California during the Mexican Period. in the 1830s-1840s, pioneers such as Johann Sutter (John Sutter) settled in the San Joaquín Valley, taking advantage of unprotected Mexican settlements that had little-to-no government oversight. Americans who wanted to live in Mexican California did have to follow Mexican law and convert to Catholicism if they wanted to become Mexican citizens. Many did, marrying into Mexican families, acquiring land grants, becoming | rancheros | , and joining the lucrative Mexican hide and tallow trade. Some of these settlers included English immigrant William Edward Petty Hartnell and Scottish immigrant John Cameron, who jumped ship in 1814 and was baptized and renamed Juan Bautista Gilroy at | Mission San Carlos Borromeo del Rio Carmelo.

As Irish Catholics, they immigrated to Catholic Mexican Alta California hoping to be spared the anti-Catholic prejudice they had experienced as residents of the United States. The City of San José named several streets after the Donner Party: Reed, Margaret, Virginia, Martha, Carrie, Patterson, Lewis, and Keyes. | 8  of | 17 | Title: Camp at Donner Lake, November 1846 | Date: November 1846 | Collection: History San José Online Catalog | Owning Institution: History San José Research Library | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/4b8b620cce6ee6c1e61ebe47b505ead5/ | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | Watch The Donner Party | American Experience | Official Site | PBS | Endless Winter: A Fresh Look at the Donner Party Saga | KQED | William Hartnell: The Hero and His Colleges, by Sean F.

Fremont. Canadian immigrant Thomas Fallon joined Fremont’s third expedition to California and settled in Villa Branciforte (Santa Cruz). He then declared himself “captain” and crossed the Santa Cruz Mountains with the purpose of taking Pueblo San José, rejoining Fremont’s forces and raising the American flag over the | juzgado | (the Mexican city hall and jail). He later became mayor of San José in 1859, during the American period. | The tensions that arose during the war served as an indicator of the future demise of the Mexican | Californios | under American rule. During the Mexican American War (1846-1848), the only battle fought in Northern California took place in Santa Clara County. “The Battle of Santa Clara” or “The Battle of the Mustard Stalks” took place in a mustard field near today's Triton Museum. American sailors, who came ashore to buy supplies from the Mexicans, were taken hostage. The battle lasted only two hours and resulted in the death of four Mexican soldiers. The battle, ironically, impacted James Reed of the ill-fated Donner party. Reed was in the area trying to recruit a rescue team for his trapped comrades in the Sierras but was unsuccessful during wartime. In 1846, the San José-based Berryessa family fell victim to Anglo-American hostilities. José de los Reyes Beryessa and his twin sons were murdered by the California Battalion, who stole their horses. The Mexican American War ended in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. | 9  of | 17 | Title: Mapa de los Estados Unidos de Méjico: segun lo organizado y definido por las varias actas del congreso de dicha républica y construido por las mejores autoridades. | Names: Disturnell, John, 1801-1877. | Date: New York : J.

This applied to all Mexican miners, even those who were citizens. Mexicans joined foreign miners in protesting the tax, but were subdued by white militias. Many of the immigrant Hispanic miners took refuge in San Jose.

At the end of the Mexican American War, Thomas Fallon returned to San José and then to Santa Cruz, where he established a saddle business. At the beginning of the Gold Rush, Fallon took iron picks to the Sierras to sell to the miners. With his profits he bought a business/residence on the Santa Cruz Plaza and in 1849 married into a prominent Californio | family that owned Rancho Soquel. Similarly, Don Antonio María Suñol, who owned a dry goods store in San José, supplied beef and dry goods to the miners. Other Californio rancheros, such as the Bernal brothers Juan Pablo and Agustin, joined Suñol and his family driving cattle to sell to hungry miners. | Businesses prospered as would-be miners passed through Santa Clara, Milpitas, Sunnyvale, Mountain View, and San José, needing supplies on their way to the goldfields. Often, miners waited out the winters in the warmer Santa Clara Valley. Discouraged miners also left the Sierras for good and settled in agricultural valleys like Santa Clara County in search of new livelihoods.

Anglo Americans now controlled the levers of power, and Mexicans struggled to retain their political, economic, and social status. In 1850 California entered the U.S. as a free state, and San José (initially called St. Joseph by the Americans) was the first incorporated city, growing rapidly from approximately 900 in 1845 to approximately 3,400 in 1860. San José also served as California’s first state capital between 1851-1853. Americans moved the central commercial district of St. Joseph away from the Mexican pueblo (known as the | colonia | ) | located on Market Street between the Guadalupe River and Santa Clara Avenue to a new area, First Street between St. John and San Fernando streets. | St. Joseph became a segregated town as the Anglo ex-miners who settled in the area attempted to subjugate the original Mexican residents, preventing them from participating in American culture, economic opportunities, and politics. Out of the 48 delegates to the 1849 California Constitutional Convention in Monterey, at least eight were prominent Mexican | Californio | families from San José. Yet Mexican Californio political power in Santa Clara County had declined dramatically by the 1870s. As a result, displaced Mexican landowners began to settle in the downtown | colonia | , alongside the pueblo’s Mexican tradesmen, craftsmen, shopkeepers, professionals, and their families. Mexican residents, now restricted to living in the footprint of the old Pueblo, were marginalized in the new Anglo community. | 12  of | 17 | Title: 1858 San José | Date: 1858 | Collection: Historic Map & Atlas Collection | Owning Institution: San José Public Library, California Room | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/7899220e49748b0009011638dee0d72d/ | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Mexican Loss of Land, 1850-1880 | At the end of the Mexican American War in 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo granted Mexican | Californios | full U.S. citizenship.

Significantly, the informal nature of land grants belonging to Mexicans, with vaguely drawn | diseño | maps, made it difficult to prove their claims, and many Mexican | Californios | lost their lands. Even if Mexican | Californios | won initially, the U.S. Congress created the Board of Land Commissioners (a result of the Land Act of 1851) in San Francisco. Mexicans gradually sold most of their land during the average 17 years it took to go through the legal process of proving their claims, and resulting funds went to English-speaking lawyers or to pay land taxes. | Mexicans also lost their land to Anglo American squatters. In some cases, such as with the Suñol and Berryessa families, Anglo squatters lynched the Mexican landowners and remained on the land, exercising their “squatters’ rights.” The Peralta family of San José and the East Bay lost all but 700 of their 49,000 acres.

As historian Stephen Pitti notes, Anglo Americans racialized their views of | Californios | seeing the entire Mexican population as oversexed, criminal degenerates. Mexicans became the victims of racial violence as self-appointed Anglo vigilantes shot or hung any Mexicans they considered criminals. | Mexican | Californios | were called “greasers,\" a term originating from the Mexicans engaged in the hide and tallow trade who, while processing beef fat, became covered with grease. In 1855 the California Greaser Act was passed, an anti-vagrancy law targeting all ethnic Mexicans. Further, the California Act of 1855 ended the State Constitutional requirement that laws be translated into both Spanish and English. These laws institutionalized racism in Santa Clara County,  encouraging harsher punishments for non-white residents. Historian Stephen PItti points out that between 1850-1864 “all but one of the accused criminals hung in the county were ethnic Mexicans.” Mexicans could not sit on a county grand jury until the 20th century, and between statehood in 1850 to 1900 Mexicans could not become a sheriff or police officer. | Without legal protection and with limited access to land or jobs, during the 1860s and 1870s a few | Californios | became bandits or highwaymen to avenge the harassment and racial discrimination Mexicans residents endured. Joaquín Murieta is the most famous of the “social bandits.” Tiburcio Vásquez, grandson of the first mayor of San José and an educated, bilingual member of an upper class | Californio | family, was another. Some | Californios | considered Vásquez a “Robin Hood,” fighting against Anglo atrocities and upholding Mexican civil rights. Anglo Americans considered him an outlaw. Accused of crimes committed from 1854 to 1874, he was tried and convicted for one murder and executed by hanging in 1875 in the jail yard behind Santa Clara County Court House across from St. James Park. While he admitted that he was an outlaw, Vásquez came to symbolize resistance due to legitimate grievances against Anglo American domination and Mexican lynchings that had become all too common. | 15  of | 17 | Title:  Tiburcio Vasquez | Description:  English | Repository:   California Historical Society | Digital Object ID:  CHS2013.1288.jpg | Photographer:  Bradley & Rulofson | Date:  circa 1874 | Preferred citation:  Tiburcio Vasquez, circa 1874, courtesy, California Historical Society, CHS2013.1288 | Source: | Https://www.flickr.com/photos/chs_commons/9788108573 | Author: California Historical Society Digital Collection | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | The Lynching of Persons of Mexican Origin or Descent in the United States, 1848 to 1928 | From the Community | America’s History of Lynching Mexicans | Mexican Criminalization continued | ANTI-VAGRANCY ACT (THE \"GREASER\" ACT) | CHAPTER CLXXV | AN ACT | To Punish Vagrants, Vagabonds, and Dangerous and Suspicious | Persons | (Approved April 30, I856) | The People of the State of California, represented in Senate and  Assembly, do enact as follows | Section 1.

According to historian Stephen Pitti, The New Almadén Mine became the first industrial site in the West to employ Mexicans. Members of the Berryessa, Alviso, and Suñol families joined other Mexican and Chilean immigrants to work at the company. As Pitti notes, the low-paid Mexican mine workers formed the largest community of Spanish speakers anywhere in California. | Gaining the expertise of miners from northern Mexico was a boon to the company. Almadén became very successful and in turn provided job security, of a sort, for Mexican workers. Workers often had to compete at Almaden: wages were kept low by workers underbidding each other to continue employment. Working conditions were also extremely hard, and Mexicans were restricted to heavy manual labor, often working in teams of six to eight men in ten-hour shifts. Laborers climbed ladders, carrying heavy sacks of ore (some up to 300 pounds) on their backs “with a strap over their forehead.” The work continued day and night, six days a week.   Work and living environments were segregated. Cornish or Irish worker families lived in “Englishtown” located down the hill from the mines, while Mexican miners’ families lived at the desolate top of the hill in “Spanishtown,” near the mine’s smokestacks that spewed mercury fumes. The toxic environment destroyed families’ attempts to raise poultry or vegetables; the company compounded the problem by dumping tailings from the mines next to and between the worker’s homes.  Unable to produce their own food, Mexican miners grew more dependent on the mine owners for food, buying expensive groceries from the nearby company store. The closest water was located a mile away at the Hacienda, the offices of company management. | Pitti notes that these harsh working and living conditions drove the Mexican miners “to make new political demands and hone a sense of Latino identity for the first time in U.S. history.” | 17  of | 17 | Title: | Spanishtown, New Almaden Mines, 1885 | Description: | Spanishtown on Mine Hill, New Almaden. | Collection: | Leonard McKay Collection | Source: History San José | Catalog Number: | 2004-17-3235 | Object Name: | Print, Photographic | Date: | 1885 | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | New Almaden Mining Historic District---American Latino Heritage | New Almaden Quicksilver County Park Association | “New Almaden and The Mexican” SJSU thesis (1977) | Previous | Next | Pre-Colonial Native Americans And Spanish Encounters | The original occupants of the Santa Clara Coun | ty were the Ohlone tribelet of the Tamyen Coastanoan-speaking tribe.

During the Mexican Period of 1821-1848, the Catholic Church lost most of its land holdings in Alta California except for property surrounding church buildings. After secularization in 1833, a wholesale transfer of land grants to the | Californios | (la gente de razon– | the Christianized residents) took place. Ranchos employed between twenty and several hundred laborers. The original plan to grant the land to the converted Indians was never implemented. A social system of seigneurialism took hold in which | Californio | rancheros | , the land owners, and their mestizo and Indio laborers lived in a world of mutual obligation. In this paternal system, | rancheros | provided housing, food, and clothing to workers in exchange for their labor. | During the combined Spanish and Mexican rancho periods, 500 land grants were issued, with the majority (450) carved from mission land holdings after secularization. Mexico’s 1824 Law of Colonization specified that the maximum land grant could be 48,400 acres, with the average being 22,000 acres. No longer restricted to trading only with Spanish galleons, Mexicans began engaging in “the hide and tallow trade” internationally. Mexican hides, known as “California dollars,” were used to make shoes, leather belts, and other items, helping  propel the United States’ early industrial revolution of the 1820s and 1830s. | Title: Painting of a Spanish Rancho Cattle Round-up | Date: circa 1840/1880 | Collection: California Historical Society Collection, 1860-1960 | Owning Institution: California Historical Society | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/3460d549a830ef1092735174158b52eb/ | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | Mexican California | Library of Congress | Land Grants in Alta California | Battle of Santa Clara - Clio | Californio Society — Calisphere | Witness to Empire: The Life of Antonio Maria Sunol | Americans During the Mexican Period, 1810s-1840s | Anglo Americans first began settling in Alta California during the Mexican Period. in the 1830s-1840s, pioneers such as Johann Sutter (John Sutter) settled in the San Joaquín Valley, taking advantage of unprotected Mexican settlements that had little-to-no government oversight. Americans who wanted to live in Mexican California did have to follow Mexican law and convert to Catholicism if they wanted to become Mexican citizens. Many did, marrying into Mexican families, acquiring land grants, becoming | rancheros | , and joining the lucrative Mexican hide and tallow trade. Some of these settlers included English immigrant William Edward Petty Hartnell and Scottish immigrant John Cameron, who jumped ship in 1814 and was baptized and renamed Juan Bautista Gilroy at | Mission San Carlos Borromeo del Rio Carmelo. He | then married into the Ortega family. | Some of the more famous American settlers of El Pueblo de San José  were members of the Donner Party, including Eliza Poor Donner, Mary Donner, William McCutchen, and the Reed Family (who purchased a 500-acre ranch between First Street and Coyote Creek). As Irish Catholics, they immigrated to Catholic Mexican Alta California hoping to be spared the anti-Catholic prejudice they had experienced as residents of the United States. The City of San José named several streets after the Donner Party: Reed, Margaret, Virginia, Martha, Carrie, Patterson, Lewis, and Keyes. | Title: Camp at Donner Lake, November 1846 | Date: November 1846 | Collection: History San José Online Catalog | Owning Institution: History San José Research Library | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/4b8b620cce6ee6c1e61ebe47b505ead5/ | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | Watch The Donner Party | American Experience | Official Site | PBS | Endless Winter: A Fresh Look at the Donner Party Saga | KQED | William Hartnell: The Hero and His Colleges, by Sean F.

Fremont. Canadian immigrant Thomas Fallon joined Fremont’s third expedition to California and settled in Villa Branciforte (Santa Cruz). He then declared himself “captain” and crossed the Santa Cruz Mountains with the purpose of taking Pueblo San José, rejoining Fremont’s forces and raising the American flag over the | juzgado | (the Mexican city hall and jail). He later became mayor of San José in 1859, during the American period. | The tensions that arose during the war served as an indicator of the future demise of the Mexican | Californios | under American rule. During the Mexican American War (1846-1848), the only battle fought in Northern California took place in Santa Clara County. “The Battle of Santa Clara” or “The Battle of the Mustard Stalks” took place in a mustard field near today's Triton Museum. American sailors, who came ashore to buy supplies from the Mexicans, were taken hostage. The battle lasted only two hours and resulted in the death of four Mexican soldiers. The battle, ironically, impacted James Reed of the ill-fated Donner party. Reed was in the area trying to recruit a rescue team for his trapped comrades in the Sierras but was unsuccessful during wartime. In 1846, the San José-based Berryessa family fell victim to Anglo-American hostilities. José de los Reyes Beryessa and his twin sons were murdered by the California Battalion, who stole their horses. The Mexican American War ended in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. | Title: Mapa de los Estados Unidos de Méjico: segun lo organizado y definido por las varias actas del congreso de dicha républica y construido por las mejores autoridades. | Names: Disturnell, John, 1801-1877. | Date: New York : J.

Others were forced to leave when selective taxes were imposed on them, such as the 1850 California Foreign Miners License Law ($20/month). This applied to all Mexican miners, even those who were citizens. Mexicans joined foreign miners in protesting the tax, but were subdued by white militias. Many of the immigrant Hispanic miners took refuge in San Jose. According to historian Stephen Pitti, between 1845-1860 the Spanish-surnamed population of San José increased by 150%. | Title: Map of the Mining District of California. | Names:  Jackson, Wm. A.

At the end of the Mexican American War, Thomas Fallon returned to San José and then to Santa Cruz, where he established a saddle business. At the beginning of the Gold Rush, Fallon took iron picks to the Sierras to sell to the miners. With his profits he bought a business/residence on the Santa Cruz Plaza and in 1849 married into a prominent Californio | family that owned Rancho Soquel. Similarly, Don Antonio María Suñol, who owned a dry goods store in San José, supplied beef and dry goods to the miners. Other Californio rancheros, such as the Bernal brothers Juan Pablo and Agustin, joined Suñol and his family driving cattle to sell to hungry miners. | Businesses prospered as would-be miners passed through Santa Clara, Milpitas, Sunnyvale, Mountain View, and San José, needing supplies on their way to the goldfields. Often, miners waited out the winters in the warmer Santa Clara Valley. Discouraged miners also left the Sierras for good and settled in agricultural valleys like Santa Clara County in search of new livelihoods. This influx of settlers initiated a decline in Mexican culture and political influence, in contrast to Southern California, which retained its Mexican majority through the 1870s. | Title: Anthony Sunol, San José's First Postmaster | Date: 1826 | Collection: History San José Online Catalog | Owning Institution: History San José Research Library | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/eb6cdcdd041b2235bbd8ea1c30b02e22/ | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | The Early American Period:  The Mexican Colonia and Anglo San José, 1848-1919 | In 1848 after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican American War, California became part of the United States. Anglo Americans now controlled the levers of power, and Mexicans struggled to retain their political, economic, and social status. In 1850 California entered the U.S. as a free state, and San José (initially called St. Joseph by the Americans) was the first incorporated city, growing rapidly from approximately 900 in 1845 to approximately 3,400 in 1860. San José also served as California’s first state capital between 1851-1853. Americans moved the central commercial district of St. Joseph away from the Mexican pueblo (known as the | colonia | ) | located on Market Street between the Guadalupe River and Santa Clara Avenue to a new area, First Street between St. John and San Fernando streets. | St. Joseph became a segregated town as the Anglo ex-miners who settled in the area attempted to subjugate the original Mexican residents, preventing them from participating in American culture, economic opportunities, and politics. Out of the 48 delegates to the 1849 California Constitutional Convention in Monterey, at least eight were prominent Mexican | Californio | families from San José. Yet Mexican Californio political power in Santa Clara County had declined dramatically by the 1870s. As a result, displaced Mexican landowners began to settle in the downtown | colonia | , alongside the pueblo’s Mexican tradesmen, craftsmen, shopkeepers, professionals, and their families. Mexican residents, now restricted to living in the footprint of the old Pueblo, were marginalized in the new Anglo community. | Title: 1858 San José | Date: 1858 | Collection: Historic Map & Atlas Collection | Owning Institution: San José Public Library, California Room | Source: Calisphere | Permalink: | https://calisphere.org/item/7899220e49748b0009011638dee0d72d/ | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Mexican Loss of Land, 1850-1880 | At the end of the Mexican American War in 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo granted Mexican | Californios | full U.S. citizenship. At that time, only white males were granted U.S. citizenship, thereby implying Mexican | Californios | were considered “white.” The Treaty also promised Californios that “their property would be inviolably respected.” However, American political leaders held racist attitudes towards Native Americans and Mexicans, considering them lazy and unproductive in terms of their land use. | Race-based laws, enacted by the state legislature in the 1850s and 1860s, institutionalized discrimination and segregation against Mexicans, Blacks, Asians, and Native Americans. Significantly, the informal nature of land grants belonging to Mexicans, with vaguely drawn | diseño | maps, made it difficult to prove their claims, and many Mexican | Californios | lost their lands. Even if Mexican | Californios | won initially, the U.S. Congress created the Board of Land Commissioners (a result of the Land Act of 1851) in San Francisco. Mexicans gradually sold most of their land during the average 17 years it took to go through the legal process of proving their claims, and resulting funds went to English-speaking lawyers or to pay land taxes. | Mexicans also lost their land to Anglo American squatters. In some cases, such as with the Suñol and Berryessa families, Anglo squatters lynched the Mexican landowners and remained on the land, exercising their “squatters’ rights.” The Peralta family of San José and the East Bay lost all but 700 of their 49,000 acres.

His family moved into Mission Santa Clara and was given one the few Spanish land grants: Rancho Buena Vista. During the Mexican period, Joaquín’s son José Mariana Castro acquired Rancho Las Animas and Rancho La Brea, near Gilroy, which was inherited by María Dolores del Carmen Castro and later María de Los Angeles Castro. In Castro’s words: | “Today I am old and poor. The young men who were my friends who made the papers for me to sign are all very rich. They have hundreds of acres of land and much money while I sit here like an old owl in the dark corner and tell the few who ask that these men have robbed me of all that was mine by their crooked talk and their crooked laws. They smile and tap their heads and say “dreaming.” And maybe it is so that I am dreaming. Maybe old age and sickness and sorrow have climbed into my eyes and brain just as ivy climbed into the broken window of my old Casa Adobe and shut out the light of reason. But this!

As historian Stephen Pitti notes, Anglo Americans racialized their views of | Californios | seeing the entire Mexican population as oversexed, criminal degenerates. Mexicans became the victims of racial violence as self-appointed Anglo vigilantes shot or hung any Mexicans they considered criminals. | Mexican | Californios | were called “greasers,\" a term originating from the Mexicans engaged in the hide and tallow trade who, while processing beef fat, became covered with grease. In 1855 the California Greaser Act was passed, an anti-vagrancy law targeting all ethnic Mexicans. Further, the California Act of 1855 ended the State Constitutional requirement that laws be translated into both Spanish and English. These laws institutionalized racism in Santa Clara County,  encouraging harsher punishments for non-white residents. Historian Stephen PItti points out that between 1850-1864 “all but one of the accused criminals hung in the county were ethnic Mexicans.” Mexicans could not sit on a county grand jury until the 20th century, and between statehood in 1850 to 1900 Mexicans could not become a sheriff or police officer. | Without legal protection and with limited access to land or jobs, during the 1860s and 1870s a few | Californios | became bandits or highwaymen to avenge the harassment and racial discrimination Mexicans residents endured. Joaquín Murieta is the most famous of the “social bandits.” Tiburcio Vásquez, grandson of the first mayor of San José and an educated, bilingual member of an upper class | Californio | family, was another. Some | Californios | considered Vásquez a “Robin Hood,” fighting against Anglo atrocities and upholding Mexican civil rights. Anglo Americans considered him an outlaw. Accused of crimes committed from 1854 to 1874, he was tried and convicted for one murder and executed by hanging in 1875 in the jail yard behind Santa Clara County Court House across from St. James Park. While he admitted that he was an outlaw, Vásquez came to symbolize resistance due to legitimate grievances against Anglo American domination and Mexican lynchings that had become all too common. | Title:  Tiburcio Vasquez | Description:  English | Repository:   California Historical Society | Digital Object ID:  CHS2013.1288.jpg | Photographer:  Bradley & Rulofson | Date:  circa 1874 | Preferred citation:  Tiburcio Vasquez, circa 1874, courtesy, California Historical Society, CHS2013.1288 | Source: | Https://www.flickr.com/photos/chs_commons/9788108573 | Author: California Historical Society Digital Collection | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | The Lynching of Persons of Mexican Origin or Descent in the United States, 1848 to 1928 | From the Community | America’s History of Lynching Mexicans | Mexican Criminalization continued | ANTI-VAGRANCY ACT (THE \"GREASER\" ACT) | CHAPTER CLXXV | AN ACT | To Punish Vagrants, Vagabonds, and Dangerous and Suspicious | Persons | (Approved April 30, I856) | The People of the State of California, represented in Senate and  Assembly, do enact as follows | Section 1.

According to historian Stephen Pitti, The New Almadén Mine became the first industrial site in the West to employ Mexicans. Members of the Berryessa, Alviso, and Suñol families joined other Mexican and Chilean immigrants to work at the company. As Pitti notes, the low-paid Mexican mine workers formed the largest community of Spanish speakers anywhere in California. | Gaining the expertise of miners from northern Mexico was a boon to the company. Almadén became very successful and in turn provided job security, of a sort, for Mexican workers. Workers often had to compete at Almaden: wages were kept low by workers underbidding each other to continue employment. Working conditions were also extremely hard, and Mexicans were restricted to heavy manual labor, often working in teams of six to eight men in ten-hour shifts. Laborers climbed ladders, carrying heavy sacks of ore (some up to 300 pounds) on their backs “with a strap over their forehead.” The work continued day and night, six days a week.   Work and living environments were segregated. Cornish or Irish worker families lived in “Englishtown” located down the hill from the mines, while Mexican miners’ families lived at the desolate top of the hill in “Spanishtown,” near the mine’s smokestacks that spewed mercury fumes. The toxic environment destroyed families’ attempts to raise poultry or vegetables; the company compounded the problem by dumping tailings from the mines next to and between the worker’s homes.  Unable to produce their own food, Mexican miners grew more dependent on the mine owners for food, buying expensive groceries from the nearby company store. The closest water was located a mile away at the Hacienda, the offices of company management. | Pitti notes that these harsh working and living conditions drove the Mexican miners “to make new political demands and hone a sense of Latino identity for the first time in U.S. history.” | Title: | Spanishtown, New Almaden Mines, 1885 | Description: | Spanishtown on Mine Hill, New Almaden. | Collection: | Leonard McKay Collection | Source: History San José | Catalog Number: | 2004-17-3235 | Object Name: | Print, Photographic | Date: | 1885 | Scholar Talk | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Remote video URL | Additional Online Information | New Almaden Mining Historic District---American Latino Heritage | New Almaden Quicksilver County Park Association | “New Almaden and The Mexican” SJSU thesis (1977)"}

Links to these can be placed in your course’s Canvas shell. | Millions of electronic journal articles and thousands of ebooks within the digital library collection are free for students. | Put copies of your textbook on | course reserves | . You determine the checkout period: two hours, 24 hours, or three days.  See | Reserve Material for My Course | . | Suggest materials for library purchase. Librarians have an annual budget to purchase materials for the Library collection to support your courses, and can request trial databases.  Contact your librarian. | Don't purchase Test Packs or Add-ons | just for quizzes and tests. These are very costly for students and the test banks can often be imported into Canvas for free. Contact | Academic Technology | for help with this. | Don't be lured in by publishers' offers to customize a text | or lower the cost by offering it as a loose-leaf version, which cannot be resold.  While these appear to be cheaper options, these are simply strategies to sell more new copies and eliminate the used book market. | Use the Announcements in your Canvas course to let students know what materials will be required | and point them to our | Resources for Students | page so they can find the best solutions for their needs and have the texts the first day of class. | Consider sticking with older versions of texts | . Publishers release “new” editions about every three years, which typically cost 12% more than the previous edition. Let the bookstore know you want the older edition or allow students to use any edition. | Rent digital textbooks | . The CSU’s | Rent Digital Textbooks Program | is saving students 60% or more on over 50,000 popular titles.  All the major textbook publishers are participating. The downside: These books are usually a 3-month rental, so may end up costing more than a used copy of a physical text that students can sell back. | Are you using multiple texts but assigning just a portion of each text? | Custom publishers such as | XanEdu | offer faculty the ability to create a custom text including articles, book chapters, websites, and other materials. Custom publishers provide copyright clearance and a running total price as you build your book. | Communicate with the | campus bookstore | : | Submitting course material requests to the bookstore on time allows them to buy back books at the end of the semester and offer a sufficient supply of used books. | Let them know if you plan to use a book for at least two years and want the book available for rent. | When ordering materials, ask the bookstore for suggestions on reducing costs and/or various packaging options. | Visit the | CSU Affordable Learning Solutions | website | to find quality free or low-cost course content, learn more about the Rent Digital program, and listen to or view discussions about AL$."}

{"url": "https://library.sjsu.edu/start-your-research/i-need-search-tips", "title": "I need search tips | Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library", "content": "I need search tips | It can be frustrating to not find what you're looking for, but sometimes all it takes to improve your results is small tweaks to your search. | General tips that work in almost any search box: | Quotation marks | search for an exact phrase. [ medical error ] finds results with those two words anywhere in the document, together or separately. But [ \"medical error\" ] finds results with that exact | phrase | . | An | asterisk | saves typing by searching for all endings to a word at the same time. [ mexic* ] searches for Mexico, Mexican, and Mexicans. Be careful not to shorten your word too much, because this can bring back results that are not relevant. [ me* ] searches for Mexico, Mexican, Mexicans, meningitis, memes, Medici, and so on. | Following are some more specific search tips for the web, the databases, and the library's OneSearch: | Web Search Tips | 1. | Keep it simple! | Start by typing the name of a thing, place, or concept that you're looking for. | [ puppy training tips ] | [ london dinner cruise ] | [ pasta recipe ] | 2. | Add relevant words | if you don't see what you want after doing a simple search. | First try: | [ puppy ] | More precise: | [ puppy training ] | Even more precise: | [ dalmatian puppy training class ] | Don't worry if it takes several attempts to find the right words to describe your search. | 3. | Try words that a website would use to describe what you're looking for | . | Not ideal: | [ my head hurts ] | Not ideal: | [ why is my head killing me ] | Better: | [ headache ] | Why? Google matches the words in your search to the words appearing in pages on the Internet. \"Headache\" is the term that informative webpages are likely to use, so using that term will help you reach the type of information you want. | 4. | Use only the important words rather than a full sentence or question. | Not ideal: [ country where bats are an omen of good luck ] | Better: [ bats good luck ] | Why? Generally, all of the words that you include in your search will be used to find matching content. Too many words will limit your results. | Database Search Tips | 1. | Too many results: | Start small! | Begin with just one or a few search terms, then add additional terms if you find you have too many results. | Use good search terms | - Try using terms that are more specific than those you originally entered. Do not use OR between terms that mean different things, for example, | women OR salary | . | Too few search terms | - Each time you put in another search term it will give you fewer results. If you only have one general term in the search box, consider what about that term interests you. | Use filters | - Filters (such as date and format) give you a more targeted results list. | Topic is too broad | - Narrow the scope of your search. Think about the various aspects of your topic that you plan to cover in your paper and search for them separately, then synthesize the information you find. Or you may need to narrow your topic because it is too large a topic to cover in a short paper. | 2. Too few results: | Is this the best database for your topic? | If you are using a database for a specific subject (education, psychology, etc.), try using a multidisciplinary database like | Academic Search Complete | or even | Google Scholar | . Be prepared to try several different databases. If you need a subject-specific database, try the | Research Guides | . | Use good search terms | - Check your spelling and brainstorm some synonyms or related terms for your concept. You can use OR between synonyms, for example | salary OR pay OR compensation | . | Too many search terms | - Each additional term in your search will get you fewer results. If you have three or more search terms, try removing one to see if your results improve. | Too many filters | - Filters (such as date and format) give you a more targeted results list, but get you fewer results. Use only those that are absolutely necessary. | Your topic is too narrow | - What is the broader theme of your topic? Break your topic down and search for different parts separately, then synthesize the information you find. | OneSearch Search Tips | 1. | What are you looking for? | OneSearch on the | library home page | is a great place to find books and articles. It searches the library's collection and all of the library's databases with a single search. | 2. | Are you looking for a specific book or article? | If so, go straight to OneSearch's | Advanced Search | and search just in the Title field. It lets you limit by other fields, too, like Author or Subject. | 3. | Want to search like a pro? | See the | Using OneSearch guide | for tips. | 4. | Looking for other ways to focus your results? | Use the \"Refine by\" column on the left side of the search results page. | 5. | Are you looking for course reserves? | The best place to search is via this | Course Reserves | link or by using the Course Reserves tab that’s part of the library home page’s search box."}

Read the abstract (a summary of the article) to know if an article is really related to the topic you're researching. If there is not an abstract, read the introduction of the article and scan the article headings. | 2. | What is the subject area focus? | Knowing what discipline an article comes from can help you decide if the article is relevant. Look at the title of the book/article or the journal title to try to determine the subject area. For example, if you are researching global warming activism for a political science class, an article on global warming from a chemistry journal may not be a great fit because it is too technical and not focused on political issues. | 3. | Are you looking for recent information? | If so, the publication date will be a critical clue to whether the article or book is relevant. | 4. | Is it a book or an article? | Some results lists will tell you specifically what the item is, but you can also tell from the citation. If your professor only wants you to use a specific type of format (like peer-reviewed journal articles), it is important to know that. | 5. | Is it scholarly? | If you are required to use only scholarly sources, you will need to figure out whether the item is scholarly or not. For books, there are | several clues you should look for | . For articles, look at the title of the journal (not the article title). You can search for the journal title in the database called | Ulrich's Periodicals Directory | to determine whether the journal is scholarly, also called peer reviewed or refereed. Note that some databases will indicate in the results whether the article is scholarly or not, and in some databases, you can limit your search to just scholarly articles. | 6. | What type of article is it? | Not every article in a journal (even a scholarly journal) may be appropriate for your research. In addition to research articles and feature articles, peer-reviewed journals contain book reviews, editorials, interviews, and more. The type of article may be apparent from the information provided by the database, but in some cases, you may need to read the abstract or even the beginning of the article before you know for sure. When in doubt about whether something is appropriate, look at your assignment instructions and/or ask your instructor. | 7. | If it is a research study, what type is it? | This may only be relevant in courses that require a specific type of research be used (quantitative, qualitative, experimental, systematic review, etc.). The abstract usually contains some clues about the type of study. Also, look in the article for a \"Methods\" section, which should describe how the research was conducted. If one does not exist, it's probably not a research study."}

There are about 30 students per semester in Econ 2B (and Econ 2A). Before, we were having them spend about $40 to a company called Aplia, which administered basically the same type of quizzes to the students. So, I think I am saving students in my class $1,200 per semester. Between both Econ 2A and Econ 2B, our department is saving students about $4,800 per year. | Course: | MBA Program | Course Material: | Online primer for the MBA program | Free PDF versions of economics and statistics principles books | Similar setup as for ECON 2B, but tailored for MBA students | Cost of Material: Free | Comments: | This saves the students about $50-100. I guess around 10 or 20 students need the primer each year, so we might estimate the savings at around $2,000 per year. | Course: | ECON 1A/1B | Course Material: | Random-draw, multiple choice quizzes, implemented through D2L | Textbook and LMS content published by Worth | Cost of Material: Free for online labs, market rate for textbook | Comments: | Students buy the textbook, but then get free online labs.  Before the integration of the LMS into the course, I was assigning a textbook and online lab bundle from Aplia.  I suppose the savings is about $30 per student, but actually the quality is higher now, for two reasons.  First, students have a hard copy of the book, whereas with Aplia, most students choose the eBook option, and the D2L Dropbox feature facilitates assigning more sophisticated assignments than was possible through Aplia.  So for around 80 students, the total savings is $2,400, with no reduction in quality. | Course: | ECON 108/205A | Course Material: | SJPL and the SJSU Library have eBook versions of the main texts for 108 | For 205A, SJSU has an ebook for one main text, and students buy the other | Cost of Material: Free for 108; about $100 for 205A | Comments: | For 205A students must buy one, fairly expensive textbook, but I think it is worth it, especially because the publisher provides excellent supplemental content.  In Econ 108 the savings is about $100 / student, and in 205A the savings is about $40 per student. There are say 30 students in each class. Total savings of $4,200 for the two classes. | Course: | ECON 121 | Course Material: | eBook version of the main text | Cost of Material: Free | Comments: | Students can get by without buying anything.  The main text costs about $60 new, and so students are saving about $30 (because they could sell the book back if they bought it.)  There are about 30 students in the class. Total savings of $900. | If I think about the total amount of money I’m saving students across all the courses I teach, I suppose it is at least $10,000 per year, and this figure would be larger if we considered the positive externalities my ALS activity has generated in our department."}

At first, the cost increases were moderate, and the price of textbooks was considered to be \"reasonable,\" since the books were published every 3 to 4 years, which allowed students to buy and sell used textbooks, allowing them to recoup much of the cost. However, this is no longer the norm: textbooks are now published every 1 to 2 years, essentially decimating the supply of used books and forcing students to purchase new textbooks every semester. This, coupled with the incredible price increases, has imposed an unnecessary financial burden on students, who are already having difficulty dealing with increases in tuition and fees. Over the past few years, I have found that fewer students are actually purchasing textbooks, instead preferring to \"skate by\": reading textbooks at the school library, at the tutoring center, sharing books with a friend, or simply forgoing a textbook altogether. My personal experience in speaking with these students is that the cost of a textbook is simply too high a burden for them to bear."}

You will need to put quotation marks around the words that are not your own and cite where they came from. | Paraphrasing | - when you state the ideas from another source in your own words. Even when you use your own words, if the ideas or facts came from another source, you need to cite where they came from. | With | paraphrasing | , you must | write out the idea in your own words | . Simply changing a few words from the original source or restating the information exactly using different words is considered plagiarism. | If you can't state an idea in your own words, you should use the direct quotation | . Want some practice? Try the interactive | Paraphrasing | tutorial. | Ideally, papers will contain a good balance of direct quotations, paraphrasing and your own thoughts. Too much reliance on quotations and paraphrasing can make it seem like you are only using the work of others and are not doing any original thinking on the topic. | The | SJSU Writing Center | provides helpful guidance on quoting and paraphrasing and explains how to make sure your paraphrasing doesn't veer into plagiarism. | This video, | How to Use Quotations In Writing Essays-APA or MLA | , from David Taylor at the University of Maryland University College's Writing Center has great examples of introducing and following up on quotes. This video, | Avoid Plagiarism in Research Papers with Paraphrases & Quotations | , also from David Taylor, provides a great example of how to paraphrase wisely. | Always properly cite an author's original idea whether you have directly quoted or paraphrased it. If you have questions about how to cite properly in your chosen citation style (APA, MLA, or Chicago), check out our | Citing and Writing Help Guide | ."}

Backing up your own points with supporting evidence from the experts makes your argument, or thesis statement, more convincing. You are creating a conversation between people who have not met, but all of them know a lot about your main topic. Now you are adding your own voice to the conversation. | This is the main difference between a scholarly research paper and any other paper | . You must include your own voice and your own analysis and ideas along with those of the experts who came before you. | All your sources, or conversation partners, must | relate back to your thesis | , or central argument, whether they agree or disagree (both are important!). It is often a good idea to address all sides of the argument regarding your thesis to make your own stronger. | What is the best way to incorporate sources into your research paper? | Three ways to present present sources in support of your central argument are: | Direct Quote | : learn more about | Quoting | ; | Paraphrase | : learn more about | Paraphrasing | ; | Summary | : much like a paraphrase, but used in cases where you are trying to give an overview of many ideas. As in paraphrasing, quotation marks are not used, but a citation is still necessary! | When including a source in your paper, remember to use these three important components: | Introductory phrase to the source material | : learn more about these | signal phrases | ; | Source material | : A direct quote, paraphrase, or summary with proper citation; | Analysis of source material | : Your response, interpretations, or arguments regarding preceding source material should follow the source material itself. This is a crucial step when incorporating source material into your paper--so do not forget about it! Remember to relate your source and analysis back to your original thesis. | Contact the | SJSU Writing Center | to get more in-depth help with integrating sources into your paper. Be sure to check out their | Homegrown Handouts | for helpful tips on grammar, punctuation, style, and the writing process."}

Here are some useful places to look for statistical sources. Depending on your topic, some of these strategies may be more useful than others. | 1.  Take a look at | Statista | . | This library database provides statistics for these topics: industries; consumer goods; internet; media & advertising; retail & trade; sports & recreation; technology & telecommunications; transportation & logistics; and travel, tourism & hospitality. It also contains some government statistics, such as births and deaths. | (To open the database, you will need to sign in with your student ID and MySJSU password.) | 2. Take a look at the | Finding Data and Statistics research guide | . | This research guide goes over how to cite data and statistics in papers, and lists various data and statistics resources organized by topic. To see the resources available for your research topic, click the | Find Data & Statistics by Topic | menu heading, and select the topic area that most closely relates to your research topic from the drop down menu. | 3. Take a look at the research guides most related to your topic | . Most of the library's | Research Guides | offer links to useful statistical and data sources in that subject area. Look for a | Statistics | or | Data | heading in the research guide. Since a huge number of statistical resources come from the U.S. Government, be sure to take a look at the | Government Information | guide. | 4.  Look for specific groups that might do research on your topic | . Think about who would be interested in your topic. What government agencies? What advocacy groups or associations? What think tanks or institutes? What companies? Then look at the websites and/or search for reports from these groups on your topic. | 5.  Search the web. | There are a lot of great statistical sources freely available on the web. Doing a search for the kind of evidence you're looking for with the word | statistics (or data) | next to it may provide some helpful results. Always watch out for the sponsored results and advertisements that can look like regular search results (like the Terrapass one below). When finding things on the Web, always evaluate the source the information is coming from. Is it a reliable, trustworthy, and/or unbiased source? | Image | 5.  Use OneSearch. | OneSearch contains books and government information containing useful statistical information. Using OneSearch's | Advanced Search | option, search for your topic under Keyword and | statistics | under Subject. If you're looking for recent information, make sure you limit the date range to the past 2 or 5 years."}

If you're looking for a specific item, just do a basic search with the title in quotes (for example, “Diary of Anne Frank”). | If you are looking for primary sources on a certain topic, you're going to need to do an | advanced search | with subject headings: | On the first line, enter | keyword(s) | that describe your topic (in the image below, it's the Spanish Civil War). | On the second line, use the drop-down arrow next to the search box to choose | Subject | and select one of the subject headings in the list below that describe different kinds of primary sources. If there are multiple subject headings you want to use, put an OR between them (be sure to capitalize it). For example, you could search for \" | medieval\" | as a keyword and | sources OR documents OR personal narratives | as subject headings. | Subject Headings | To find any kind of primary source - | Sources | OR | documents | (examples: medieval sources, Civil War documents, papal sources) | Personal accounts, autobiographies, or memoirs - | Personal narratives OR autobiography OR memoir | (examples: Pearl Harbor personal narratives, Battle of the Bulge memoir, autobiography World War II) | Letters - | Correspondence | OR | letters | (examples: Civil War correspondence, French Revolution letters) | Diaries - | Diary | (examples: Civil War diary, woman diary France) | Oral history - | Interview | OR | oral history | OR | speeches | (examples: Cold War interview, Japanese internment oral history, Malcolm X speeches) | Pamphlet - | Pamphlet | (examples: pamphlet chastity, rights of women pamphlet) | Photographs or artwork - | Pictorial works | (examples: Chicago pictorial works, World's Fair pictorial works) | Once you find one useful primary source in the catalog, take a look at the subject headings associated with it by opening the record then scrolling down the page and looking for the | Subject | heading. All of the subjects you will see listed in the record are live links and clicking on them will take you to a list of everything the library has on that subject. | 2. | Search in Google Books | - if your topic is pre-1923, there are likely a lot of primary sources available on your topic in the public domain. Google has digitized books from many of the world's major research libraries and is making all of the works in the public domain freely available in Google Books. You can search for a specific work or a general topic. The annoying thing about Google Books is that they also list resources that are only available to preview. If you use the | Advanced Book Search | , you can limit your search to full view only books. | 3. | Search in Library Databases | : The Library has some major collections of primary source materials that might be useful to you. The | SJSU Special Collections & Archives | guide lists many databases available for specific subject areas. | These guides also provide subject-specific lists of primary source resources: | American Studies | History | Religious Studies"}

Just because you think of the word | salary | does not mean that all of the authors are using that word. They might use terms like | wages, pay, income, or earnings | . | Searching for all of those terms together with OR between them (for example: | gender OR pay OR wages OR income OR earnings | ) tells the search engine to find at least one of these terms in your search results.

Some professors require you to use only scholarly peer-reviewed journals, primary sources, newspapers, or books from the library while others might be more flexible in the types of sources used. Here are some source terms you should be familiar with: | Scholarly article: | Written by an expert in the field and reviewed by peers who are experts in the same area. In many databases, you can limit your search to scholarly, peer-reviewed or refereed journals to weed out any non-scholarly content. You can learn how to identify and find them in our | Finding Peer-Reviewed Articles | guide. | Professional/trade article: | Trade or professional journals can have articles written by experts in the field or by staff writers. The articles are only reviewed by editors for style, so they go through a less rigorous review process. The articles often do not contain reference lists. Examples of trade journals include | School Library Journal, Harvard Business Review, Engineering and Mining Journal, | and | American Biology Teacher. | Popular journals: | Written for a general audience rather than for professionals or scholars. Examples include | The New Yorker, People, | and | Rolling Stone | . | Primary source | : An item that was created during the period being studied and documents in some way what is being studied. Examples include newspaper accounts, government documents, letters, diaries, autobiographies, speeches, oral histories, museum artifacts, and photographs. Learn more in our | Primary Source | guide. | Secondary source | : A source that is one step removed from an event and analyzes primary sources. Examples include a book about World War II that is based on records from the time or a journal article about Chinese immigrants to San Francisco. Most books and articles are secondary sources. | Next, think about what types of evidence you need to answer your research question or make your case. This chart makes suggestions for specific types of resources for your research: | If you need | Try using | Expert evidence | Scholarly articles, books, and statistical data | Public or individual opinion on an issue | Newspapers, magazines, and websites | Basic facts about an event | Newspapers and books | Eyewitness accounts | Newspapers, primary source books, and web-based collection of primary sources | A general overview of a topic | Books or encyclopedias | Information about a very recent topic | Websites, newspapers, and magazines | Local information | Newspapers, websites, and books | Information from professionals working in the field | Professional/trade journals"}

You want a focused topic that will make a good paper. | Here are some things to consider: | Make sure your topic meets the assignment requirements. | Read it closely. Ask your professor for feedback if you are unsure. | Choose a topic that is interesting to you. | It may seem obvious, but this will make the research process more fun and engaging for you. | Choose a topic others have written about. | You will find far more resources this way. | Consider the scope of your topic. | If your topic is too broad it may be hard to find information that is focused and relevant; if your topic is too narrow it may be hard to find any information at all. | Here's one strategy for developing a research topic once you have a broad topic in mind: | Background research can help you develop your topic. | This will help you learn more about your topic and may also help you hone or change it in more appropriate ways. Though this seems like extra work, it is actually a vital, time-saving step. Knowing more about your topic's background can only help you develop a more effective topic, and therefore, research paper. | Brainstorm concepts. | Once you think of a broad topic that interests you, try to brainstorm all of the words or concepts you can that might be related to that topic. For example, if your topic is \"polar bears,\" you might think of the following words and topics in association: ice, cubs, pollution, hunting, diet, and environmental icon. It may help to write this process down. | Develop a research question. | Once you have come up with a broad research topic and done some background research, you may want to develop a research question or a question you're going to answer in your research paper by doing in-depth research. | What's your general approach to the topic? | Think about some general approaches that may help you further develop your topic: your research could use a historical angle, focusing on a particular time period; a geographical angle, focusing on a particular part of the world; or a sociological angle, focusing on a particular group of people. | Start doing some exploratory, in-depth research. | As you do more in-depth research (like looking for scholarly articles, books, and other sources to include in your paper), you can and probably will modify or refine your topic based on what you find. | Research is a dynamic process | . Don't be afraid to discover new things and modify or refine your topic. | The topic development process will help you to develop your thesis, which is essentially your proposed answer to your research question. You will then be ready to use the sources you've found and find more sources in order to support that thesis or to answer your research question. | Here's an example of how the topic development process above can lead you to a thesis: | Resources that can help you develop your topic: | Your instructor, SJSU librarians, course readings, class notes, Wikipedia, and Google | can all be helpful in terms of getting ideas for broad topics for further, in-depth research using more scholarly resources. | Research Guides | created by subject librarians are great for helping you choose where to begin your research. | These online guides can help you identify encyclopedias, books, databases, and other materials that will help you get started with research in your chosen academic field. | Library resources like | CQ Researcher | and subject-specific encyclopedias can help you come up with topic ideas because they provide great overviews and introductions to topics. | You can find links to these kinds of resources in the | Research Guides | mentioned above.

For those who have been in custody, incarceration commonly is a time of darkness and despair. For some, the experience of confinement leads to creative release through art. | This exhibit features the art of several individuals who find freedom in art. They create as a means of self-expression and connection with others, to share their vision with those who would see the world through their eyes. The artwork featured is from clients of the Record Clearance Project (RCP). | RCP has two programs: Service Navigation Mentoring Program and Legal Services. The Mentoring Program assists people as they leave custody to move forward in their lives. With the guidance of experienced mentors who have had their own criminal records expunged, justice-involved individuals gain structure and life skills to open doors to new futures. Creating art helps with healing. The Legal Services program informs people regarding their rights to a clear record, advises them about steps in clearing their record, and represents them in court. | Their art and creation enrich us all. | An African American Book Festival: Celebrating Black San Jose Bay Area Authors | Hosted by SJSU King Library's AAACNA Studies Center | February 1 - March 16, 2024 | 5th Floor, AAACNA Studies Center, | Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library | In celebration of Black History Month, a collection of Bay Area Black Authors’ books will be on display encompassing various genres, History, Biography/Memoir, Self-Help/Self-Awareness, Novels, Children's books, Christianity, Art, and Photo books. This exhibit will highlight the importance of Black Studies, Black voices, and Black Authors who use the artform of the written word to preserve history for the empowerment of the Black community. | For a list of programs celebrating Black History Month, please visit: | library.sjsu.edu/bhm | . | Coming Soon | For All the People: A Century of Citizen Action in Health Care Reform | March - April 2024 | 2nd Floor, DiNapoli Gallery, | Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. Library | The National Library of Medicine produced For All the People: A Century of Citizen Action in Health Care Reform/Para todo el pueblo: Un siglo de acción ciudadana en la reforma de la atención de la salud, guest curated by historian and educator Beatrix Hoffman, PhD (Northern Illinois University). This bilingual, 12-banner exhibition is the counterpart to the English-only For All the People exhibition. | The traveling exhibition explores a history of health care reform, which has been a contentious political issue in the United States for more than a hundred years. Often, the public associates health care reform with presidents and national leaders, but communities, workers, activists, and health care professionals have made their voices heard in the debate about whether and how to make quality health care available to all. For All the People/Para todo el pueblo tells the lesser-known story of how movements of ordinary citizens helped shape the changing American health care system. | The National Library of Medicine produced this exhibition and companion | website | . | South Asians in Silicon Valley | April 1, 2024 - May 31, 2024 | 5th Floor, AAACNA Studies Center, | SJSU King Library | Program organizers will host an exhibit and symposium showcasing the experiences and contributions of South Asians in the area. Artifacts selected by and collected from community members will demonstrate, teach and highlight their rich legacies.

Jr. Library | This exhibition features Ukrainian children’s artwork created in the Fall of 2022, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine lasted for over 6 months, and caused thousands of deaths and millions of persons displaced from their homes. | The artwork depicts experiences of children (ages 4-16 years old) during the military conflict, their fears, hopes, and perceptions of war. | Musical Instruments of South Asia | July 2 - August 29, 2024 | 2nd Floor, DiNapoli Gallery, | Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. Library | The organizers of South Asians in Silicon Valley will host an exhibit Explore the wide variety of musical instruments of South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), through paintings and photographs. | Accompanying audio clips will bring the sounds of South Asia come alive. | Find out about the ‘rubab’ from Afghanistan and its probable descendant, the ‘sarod’ of India. Many of these instruments are cultivated by the South Asian diaspora in Silicon Valley. The month-long ‘Musical Instruments of South Asia’ exhibit will culminate with a half-day music program, \"Sounds of South Asia,\" on the second floor of the library where local musicians will demonstrate vocal and instrumental music traditions. | Endangered Places in an Urban Setting | September 4 - October 31, 2024 | 2nd Floor, DiNapoli Gallery, | Dr. Martin Luther King.

The photographs will include various landmarks and signs from across San José that hold historical and architectural significance. | Gabriel Ibarra is a local photographer who has photographed the Bay Area for over 30 years. | Begin Again | November 5, 2024 - January 5, 2025 | 2nd Floor, DiNapoli Gallery, | Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. Library | Everyday, we begin again.  Yet all beginnings are not equal.  We emerge from a pandemic differently than we do from a break up, we step into revelations about the self differently than we step into our cars to go to work each day.  The impact of change varies, but the process is strangely similar—release, anger, grief, discovery, and the awkward joy that’s possible in the new. | Begin Again, is a series of mixed media works that draw from a period in my life that was chock full of change.  In eight years I’ve understood myself as a physical being, left a career that was killing me, started a career that brings me joy, received my autism diagnosis, weathered a pandemic, stepped into my gender expression, and that’s just the ‘big stuff'.  I needed a visual language full of shocking color, movement, and texture to express the immediacy and complexity--both personal and utterly universal--of these times. | As you walk through the DiNapoli Gallery, I hope you’ll engage with your own feelings about change.  Where are you ready to let something go and where are you ready to begin again? | More Information | Questions about the DiNapoli Exhibit Gallery? | Located on the second floor of King Library, the Jennifer and Philip DiNapoli exhibit gallery is a dedicated community space aimed at hosting educational, cultural, and thought-provoking art exhibits year-round for the San José State University and San José community. | Exhibit proposals for the 2025 calendar year (Jan. 2025 - Dec. 2025) are open. | SUBMIT NOW | For information about the DiNapoli Exhibit Gallery (second floor), contact Mariah Ramsour, at | mariah.ramsour@sjsu.edu | . | Visitor Form | Did you visit or plan to visit an SJSU King Library exhibit?

ARAWG is also responsible for gathering and sharing information from groups involved in implementing the action plan and building transparency between library employees and administration. | King Library Anti-Racism Action Plan | Following the events after George Floyd's death in the summer of 2020, the SJSU King Library sought to develop an anti-racist culture and workplace. After various virtual DEI and anti-racism training sessions and discussions, library administration solicited employee input on improving library policies and fostering an anti-racist library workplace via an anonymous survey. The results from the survey came to be known as the Library's Anti-Racism Action Plan. ARAWG is one of two groups developed as a starting point to carry out the items on the Library’s Anti-Racism Action Plan. | Framework & Process | From Summer 2020 to Fall 2022, ARAWG created recommendations for developing an anti-racist workplace and library by using the input of library employees and adapting | GRC Pundit's Improving Policies Through Metrics Framework. | Through an ongoing 10-week consensus process and conducting a 4-week voting timeline between the working group and the library, ARAWG was able to make progress on the Action Plan. | ARAWG Committee Members | Members of the ARAWG Committee volunteered for service in response to an open call made to SJSU King Library employees in April 2021. | 2021 - 2022 Members | Adriana Poo (Co-chair) | Academic Liaison Librarian | (408) 808-2019 | adriana.poo@sjsu.edu | Neil Ordinario (Co-chair) | Library Technology Coordinator | (408) 808-2370 | neil.ordinario@sjsu.edu | Anamika Megwalu | Faculty Director of Library Instruction and Assessment | (408) 808-2089 | anamika.megwalu@sjsu.edu | Sharesly Rodriguez | UX Librarian | (408) 808-2655 | sharesly.rodriguez@sjsu.edu | Sharon Thompson | Student Technology Training Coordinator | (408) 808-2017 | sharon.thompson@sjsu.edu | Sylvia Ruiz | Executive Assistant to the Dean | (408) 808-2107 | sylvia.ruiz@sjsu.edu | Christina Mune (Administration) | Associate Dean of Innovation & Resource Management | (408) 808-2046 | christina.mune@sjsu.edu | Melissa Chu (Administrative Assistant) | Assistant to the Library Associate Deans | (408) 808-2445 | melissa.chu@sjsu.edu | Past Members | Erika Johnson, Institutional Repository & Digital Scholarship Coordinator, 2021 - 2022 | Lesley Seacrist, Project & Communications Analyst, 2021 - 2022 | Justin Villena, Student Computing & Media Services Coordinator, 2021 - 2022 | DeeAnn Tran, Senior Assistant Librarian, 2021 - 2022 | Karen Schlesser, Resources and Analytics, 2021 - 2022 | Recommendations & Accountability Dashboard | Our dashboard tracks the progress of the SJSU King Library to implement recommendations on the following six key areas: | Budget | Leadership | Recruitment | Retention | Security | Student Assistants | The next committee will be charged to prioritize and provide next steps. | Updated 6/20/23 | Toggle all | Recommendations | Area | Project Status | JSON | XML | CSV | TXT | SQL | MS-Excel | Recommendations | Area | Retention, Training & Learning | Recruitment | Budget | Leadership | Security | Student Assistant Retention, Training & Learning | Project Status | Loading, please wait | Recommendations | Area | Project Status | Create clear procedures and guidelines for employees to report all incidents, including but not limited to racist incidents (TBD).

Although the term \"Desi\" is often used for the larger South Asian community, in our case the term refers specifically to people from India or of Indian origin. As the library records the stories, members of the community will get the opportunity to reflect on their lives in Silicon Valley. | It is well known that Silicon Valley is inhabited by very high numbers of Indians and people of Indian origin. From the software engineering sector to education to medical professions to service professions such as gas station owners, taxi drivers, restaurant owners, and grocery store owners and their employees, Indians from different parts of India call Silicon Valley home. Census, housing, and salary data reveal a dynamic and complex ethnographic story that few other locations in the world can claim. | What have been the unique experiences of Indians in Silicon Valley? How have they embraced Silicon Valley and how has Silicon Valley returned the favor? What stories do Silicon Valley’s Indians want others to know, including forthcoming generations? What makes Silicon Valley \"home\" for so many Indians, beyond the glitter of high-tech jobs, exorbitant house prices, seemingly limitless affluence, and gorgeous weather all year round? How are Desis of Silicon Valley different from other Desis in the USA? How have the Desis influenced Silicon Valley culture? | The Oral History project will provide rich primary source material for researchers, scholars, historians, policy makers, and students on how a region of the Global South has contributed to and been shaped by Silicon Valley, which has itself been redefined by the skilled and talented from Indian shores. | Desis of Silicon Valley Speak: Highlights | Desis of Silicon Valley Speak: Highlights | from | SJSU King Library | on | Vimeo | . | Interviews | What is an Oral History? | Similar Oral History Projects | Contribute interviews to | Desis of Silicon Valley Speak | Jay Raman | Neeraj Dhar | Sujit Saraf | Usha Srinivasan | Vandana Kumar & Vijay Rajvaidya | Rights & Permissions | The recorded interviews will become available for public use for research purposes through the online Oral History Collections portal. Participants will be asked to sign a consent form around the time of recording in order to understand the terms of the interview. Participants will transfer all rights, permissions, and interest to the interviews for use of the content for future scholarship. | Acknowledgement | A Central RSCA (Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activities) Grant from San Jose State University helped begin the | Desis of Silicon Valley Speak: An Oral History | . We hired two students who helped with transcribing and developed the public-facing landing page of the project. | Initial conversations with Library Administration and the Faculty Director of AAACNA (Africana, Asian American, Chicano, & Native American Studies Center) helped in designing the project. Advice from the Faculty Director of Special Collections and Archives continues to guide the development of the project. Bernd Becker, the Faculty Director of Reference and User Services, helped in the drafting of the RSCA grant proposal. He recorded the first few interviews on location in 2019 when in-person meetings were still possible and made them digitally accessible. He also developed the technical guide for students to work with the videos and transcripts. Librarians Ann Agee and Jane Dodge stepped in to complete transcribing work for the five inaugural videos. | The technical development of and access to the Oral History collection would not be possible without the meticulous attention of and constant support of | Jessie Cai, Discovery and Web Development Analyst | Laurel Eby, Web Services Librarian | Lyna Nguyen, Website and Applications Administrator | Finally, we thank the interviewees for their time and willingness to share their journeys in Silicon Valley."}

In 2020, just 9.5% of librarians identified as Black or African American, 9.9% as Hispanic or Latino (of any race), and 3.5% as Asian-American or Pacific Islander. The most recent comprehensive survey of the archival profession was conducted in 2006, but similarly found that just 7% of archivists identified as people of color. | Reasons for the lack of diversity in library and archives professions are as numerous as they are nuanced. Studies over the years have noted the social, economic and cultural barriers, as well as the lack of support BIPOC students face when entering library and archives professions. As a result, graduates of LIS programs often do not reflect the communities they serve, which impacts how librarians engage, provide services to and represent their communities. | Proposed Project, Target Group, and Beneficiaries | BIPOC Become Librarians ( | BBL) will expose more BIPOC students to Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) career paths by focusing on the two areas with the most impact on increasing diversity: mentorship and internship. | BBL’s project goals will benefit from SJSU and SJPL’s location in Santa Clara County and the City of San José, the most diverse metro area in the country, which will directly enhance our ability to conduct outreach to BIPOC undergraduate students both in schools and in the community. | We anticipate 60 undergraduate students in ten focus groups during the first year of BBL. These undergraduate students will continue to the next phase of BBL in year two, where they will be paired with a mentor and an internship program. | The cohort of students who participate in our BBL mentorship program will certainly benefit from this program, but we also anticipate the beneficiaries of BBL will include our immediate partners, who will gain visibility in the short-term, and the broader community, who will gain richer engagement with more diverse perspectives in the long-term. For example, in the short-term, we anticipate our partner SJSU iSchool will experience a higher number of applications for its MLIS program, which will lead to an increase in BIPOC graduates holding MLIS degrees entering the librarian and archival professions. Our partner SJPL, along with many other library systems nationwide, will be able to recruit and hire from a larger pool of MLIS graduates who are BIPOC, which will help them increase diversity in their own libraries as well as in | the librarian and archival workforce. | What is more, in the long-term, our work with BIPOC undergraduate students in BBL will help expose more students to an MLIS degree and LIS as a viable career choice. Our target group’s potential entry into LIS careers will increase diversity in the librarian profession and expand the community’s view and engagement with librarians from diverse backgrounds. Public library patrons of large library systems similar to SJPL will be able to engage with librarians who | represent the BIPOC community and can bring a deeper and richer perspective to the LIS workforce. As a result, libraries overall will benefit from diversity in their workforce to meet the needs of the broader communities they serve and represent. Other sectors that hire MLIS graduates will also benefit from a growing pool of BIPOC candidates. | Publications and Presentations | Presentations | Hwang, H. & Villagran, M. A. L.

Welcome to the Africana, Asian American, Chicano, & Native American Studies Center’s Kwanzaa celebration. Kwanzaa is a time when we come together as friends, family, and community. Dr. Maulana Karenga, professor of Black Studies at California State University, Long Beach, is credited with originating the celebration in 1966 by combining customs from various East African harvest ceremonies in order to introduce Africans/African Americans and others to African values, customs and traditions, and to promote unity within the African/African American community. | Here at SJSU, in late December when finals are completed and we’re about to depart to be with our families to rest, rejuvenate, and celebrate the holiday season, the Africana, Asian American, Chicano Native American Studies Center hosts a pre-Kwanzaa celebration in which we recognize the seven principles of unity. For over 10 years, Dr. David Piper, a member of the AAACNA Advisory Board, and his colleagues from Jaliya, a drumming group, have led this celebration for the San Jose community in the AAACNA Center. | We present this recording of a Kwanzaa celebration led by Dr. Piper at Mission College in Santa Clara. We share it with you in hopes that you will take the time to reflect on the aesthetics of Kwanzaa. Enjoy the video and remember to stop by next year to celebrate our community feast! Let us give thanks. — Kathryn Blackmer Reyes, Director of the AAACNA Studies Center | Customary Greeting | Habari gani. Habari gani ndugu? | (How are you, friend?) | Kukaribisha. | (Welcome.) | Both phrases are Swahili words originating in Dutch colonized parts of East Africa ( | Alkebu-lan — | Mother of Humankind). | Ntoo mu Amadou Bamba le ti. | (My name is Amadou Bamba, in the Mandinka language from the Mali community.) | Kwanzaa Rituals | Kwanzaa is celebrated through rituals, dialogue, narratives, poetry, dancing, singing, drumming and other music, and feasting. The Celebration takes place from December 26 to January 1. It is centered around the Nguzo Saba (the Seven Principals), the fundamental values found in the practice of Kwanzaa: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. | Kwanzaa is a celebration of life emanating from the concept of Kawaida, a philosophy of cultural and social change, defining culture as the most important component in the positive development of people. | Marcus Garvey, quoting Charles Siefert in 1938, said, “A people that do not know their own history and culture are like a tree without roots.” | The name Kwanzaa derives from the Swahili phrase \"matunda ya kwanza\" meaning \"first fruits.” | The Five Fundamental Activities | Image | The gathering of family, friends, and community. | Reverence for the Elders and Ancestors. | Commemoration of the past, learning lessons and emulating achievements of Africans/African American historical figures. | Recommitment to the highest cultural ideals, such as truth, justice, respect for people and nature, and caring for the vulnerable. | Celebration of the “Good of Life.” | It has been celebrated for more than 50 years by people who have a sense of humanness and an understanding of the importance of existence. The focus is primarily on Africans/African Americans and their contributions to humanity. | Symbolism | The celebration uses a variety of symbols that represent its spirit and focus: | Image | a Mkeka, straw mat on which all other objects are placed | the Kinara (candle holder), which holds seven candles, three red, three green, and one black, which represent the ancestral stock from which Africans/African Americans came | ears of corn representing children in the house or the community | Kikombe, the unity cup that is used to pour libations for each family member | cultural gifts | on December 31st, an African feast. | January 1st is dedicated to reflection on human life and purpose and the values of African/African American culture. | Marcus Garvey gave us the colors used for the candles in the Kinara. Black is for black people, red is for struggle, and green is for the future and the promise that comes from struggle. The celebration calls for the gathering of people to reaffirm the bonds of family and friends, to commemorate the past and pay deference to the creator. This year has been one that has challenged all of us. The nation as a whole could benefit from the practice of the seven principles. | “The world in which you were born is just one model of reality. Other cultures are not failed attempts at being you; they are unique manifestations of the human spirit.” – Wade Davis"}

Founded in 1857 as the oldest public university on the West Coast, the community that studies and works at San José State has found itself tasked with responding to various moments of crisis. Whether living through pandemics, wars, or climate crisis, the individuals who make up the SJSU community have responded with empathy, creativity, and resilience, sometimes in partnership with and sometimes as a challenge to university, city, and world leaders. | Survival Mode | explores the history of San José State University responding to crises with worldwide impact.

Politicians, journalists, friends, and family have used the word “unprecedented” numerous times over the past year to describe experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, there is a great deal of precedence and lessons to be learned from past successes and mistakes in how human society has responded to historic moments of crisis. | Moderated by Leslye M. Tinson, (Lecturer in the Departments of Psychology and African American Studies), this interdisciplinary panel of SJSU scholars features Dr. Natalie Boero (Sociology), Dr. Marcelle Dougan (Public Health), and Dr. Soma Sen (Social Work), discussing how history tends to repeat itself, especially in the treatment of marginalized communities. | 1914 World War I | Gardening became popular during World War I and COVID-19. | 1918 Spanish Influenza | SJSU cared for influenza patients in 1918. | 1942 Japanese American Incarceration | Japanese American incarceration interrupted the lives of 115 SJSU students. | 1948 Polio Outbreak | Sometimes in a crisis, staying in place is the safest | choice | . | 1970 Climate Pollution Protests | Reasons for | wearing masks appear throughout history, and not always to protect from disease. | 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic | We remain determined to protect our families and communities. | Explore the Exhibit | Give Us Feedback | Support the ongoing growth and care of our University Archives by donating to the San José State University Special Collections and Archives Endowment. | Exhibit Contributors: | Carli V.

In Chinese culture, lanterns play a big role in heralding the arrival of the Lunar New Year. It is widely believed that hanging lanterns brings good luck and prosperity. | The lanterns are created by the members of the Chan Lim Family of Artists. They are best-known for their Asian-themed art with a particular focus on Chinese brush painting. The family has been actively engaged in the arts for more than half a century to date. The three generations of the Chan Lim Family use a multitude of media, styles, and techniques to incorporate Western into Eastern art. Over the years, they have continuously pushed the envelope on the type of media used for the Chinese brush. Their art subjects have included traditional brush painting themes, such as flora, fauna, landscape, even portraits. These themes can be seen in most of the family’s art, as well as their students.

The event concludes with a live demonstration of the virtual reality exhibit from Jon Oakes, Technology Labs Coordinator at SJSU King Library. | Curators of \"21@2021\" | “VR isn't just for gaming, it can be for art exhibits, too. Something I didn't realize before is how having our exhibit online still allows us to have interactive experiences in virtual environments. What I'm most excited about is how users will be able to interact with the art pieces by picking up some of lanterns and examining them close-up. Having this exhibit online has prompted Felix and I to explore ways to integrate technology into our art and find creative solutions.\" | – | B | obbi Makani-Lim, Ph.D. | “The '21@2021' Virtual Exhibit allowed me to think outside of the box and taught me how to integrate technology and art. For example, I've learned how photogrammetry can make a huge difference in virtual environments. What might seem like little changes in reflection, light, angles, and other elements can be drastic in how real a virtual environment feels to users. What I'm most excited about is showing this exhibit to a wider audience and being able to share with others how we were able to converge technology and art.\" | – Felix Chan Lim, Ph.D. | \"This online exhibit is part of the Africana, Asian American, Chicano, and Native American (AAACNA) Studies Center’s work to bring forth diverse voices through our exhibits. I am honored that Prof. Makani and Lim for sharing their work and for bringing their cultural art to this VR environment. Originally, this exhibit was to have been a physical exhibit in 2020 but obviously plans changed. While the physical exhibit would have been an exciting and exuberating experience, the VR platform provides for a new dimension for an up close look at the artistry created by the Chan Lim Family. My thanks to the wonder team of people that help make this VR experience as well.\" | — Kathryn Blackmer Reyes, Librarian & Director, AAACNA Studies Center | \"At the start of the pandemic, we were challenged to find a way to showcase exhibits in a virtual environment. It forced all of us to reexamine how we host exhibits and how to visually tell a story in this digital world. Together, with Bobbi and Felix, we came up with a plan to create 3D models of the artwork. It is gratifying to finally share this work which was created over many months of trial and error. All in all, over 500 hours of human and computer time were used to create the scenes, render the lanterns, and place the artwork in the galleries.\" | — Jon Oakes, Technology Labs Coordinator"}

{"url": "https://library.sjsu.edu/festivaloflanterns#main-content", "title": "Festival of Lanterns | Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library", "content": "Festival of Lanterns | Festival of Lanterns | Hosted by the Africana, Asian American, Chicano, & Native American Studies Center and in celebration of Asian Pacific Heritage Month, the “Festival of Lanterns” exhibit presents Chinese brush painting on colorful lanterns. In Chinese culture, lanterns play a big role in heralding the arrival of the Lunar New Year. It is widely believed that hanging lanterns brings good luck and prosperity. | The lanterns are created by the members of the Chan Lim Family of Artists. They are best-known for their Asian-themed art with a particular focus on Chinese brush painting. The family has been actively engaged in the arts for more than half a century to date. The three generations of the Chan Lim Family use a multitude of media, styles, and techniques to incorporate Western into Eastern art. Over the years, they have continuously pushed the envelope on the type of media used for the Chinese brush. Their art subjects have included traditional brush painting themes, such as flora, fauna, landscape, even portraits. These themes can be seen in most of the family’s art, as well as their students. The “Festival of Lanterns” exhibit is a continuity of the \"21@2021\" virtual lantern exhibit launched last year. | Explore Festival of Lanterns in Virtual Reality (\"21@2021\") | Note: (Firefox is recommended) | As you explore, use the W (forward), A (left), S (backward), and D (right) keys to navigate the room.

Exhibit curator, artist, and faculty member, Dr. Bobbi Makani from the Lucas College and Graduate School of Business at SJSU discusses Chinese culture through the lens of Chinese brush painting followed by a live demonstration from two exhibit artists, Dr. Felix Chan Lim from Stanford University Continuing Studies Program and Dr. Alex Chan Lim. The event concludes with a live demonstration of the virtual reality exhibit from Jon Oakes, Technology Labs Coordinator at SJSU King Library. | Curators of \"21@2021\" | “VR isn't just for gaming, it can be for art exhibits, too. Something I didn't realize before is how having our exhibit online still allows us to have interactive experiences in virtual environments. What I'm most excited about is how users will be able to interact with the art pieces by picking up some of lanterns and examining them close-up. Having this exhibit online has prompted Felix and I to explore ways to integrate technology into our art and find creative solutions.\" | – | B | obbi Makani-Lim, Ph.D. | “The '21@2021' Virtual Exhibit allowed me to think outside of the box and taught me how to integrate technology and art. For example, I've learned how photogrammetry can make a huge difference in virtual environments. What might seem like little changes in reflection, light, angles, and other elements can be drastic in how real a virtual environment feels to users. What I'm most excited about is showing this exhibit to a wider audience and being able to share with others how we were able to converge technology and art.\" | – Felix Chan Lim, Ph.D. | \"This online exhibit is part of the Africana, Asian American, Chicano, and Native American (AAACNA) Studies Center’s work to bring forth diverse voices through our exhibits. I am honored that Prof. Makani and Lim for sharing their work and for bringing their cultural art to this VR environment. Originally, this exhibit was to have been a physical exhibit in 2020 but obviously plans changed. While the physical exhibit would have been an exciting and exuberating experience, the VR platform provides for a new dimension for an up close look at the artistry created by the Chan Lim Family. My thanks to the wonder team of people that help make this VR experience as well.\" | — Kathryn Blackmer Reyes, Librarian & Director, AAACNA Studies Center | \"At the start of the pandemic, we were challenged to find a way to showcase exhibits in a virtual environment. It forced all of us to reexamine how we host exhibits and how to visually tell a story in this digital world. Together, with Bobbi and Felix, we came up with a plan to create 3D models of the artwork. It is gratifying to finally share this work which was created over many months of trial and error. All in all, over 500 hours of human and computer time were used to create the scenes, render the lanterns, and place the artwork in the galleries.\" | — Jon Oakes, Technology Labs Coordinator"}

With your support, we're moving closer to completing the space and welcoming students, faculty, and the community to the DHC. | March 16, 2023 Update | SJSU's Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library and the College of Humanities and the Arts have met our second year goal of $100,000 with a generous donation from the Adobe Foundation. The donation is a part of the Adobe Foundation's $2 million grant to SJSU to support diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, mentorship and professional development, faculty research, and social justice programming. | Adobe Foundation's grant to the DHC recognizes the space as not only a center to explore and learn about digital humanities but also as a central hub offering technology and expert consultation to support digital literacy skill building for SJSU, K-12 educational institutions, and public stakeholders, such as local non-profits. The DHC will help bridge the growing gap in critical digital literacy and in-demand 21st century workforce skills, which aligns strongly with Adobe Foundation’s commitment to | Adobe for All | . | We are deeply grateful for Adobe Foundation's support and partnership in our work to bring the DHC to SJSU and look forward to continuing to work together. | As year three begins this spring, we look forward to sharing developments on the space in the King Library. | Programming, resources | and | faculty projects | in digital humanities continue to grow as well. | Progress on our third-year goal, along with | updates on the DHC | will be shared throughout the year. As the DHC progresses, it will be added to the growing list of | resources SJSU offers in digital humanities | . | We thank you for taking this incredible journey with us as we leave year two behind and head into year three. With your commitment and support, we will bring a Digital Humanities Center to SJSU! | November 1, 2022 Update | DIGITAL HUMANITIES RESEARCH INSTITUTE A HUGE SUCCESS | Over 110 people from San José State, San Diego State, and other California institutions registered for our first Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI), | Networked Connections: Explorations Across Digital Humanities | .

In collaboration with San Diego State University’s Digital Humanities Center and SJSU’s College of Humanities and Arts, the DHRI is an immersive Digital Humanities (DH) program that focuses on building communities of practice (CoP) around digital humanities to support the growing research, teaching, and scholarship in this field at the different California State University (CSU) campuses and in the communities they serve. The DH program includes a two-day virtual symposium followed by a series of methods-based workshops and one-on-one consultations open to faculty and students from SJSU and across the CSU system. | Leading the DHRI is Christina Mune, Associate Dean of SJSU King Library, and Pamela Lach, Director of SDSU’s Digital Humanities Center. Shares Christina, ”SJSU King Library looks forward to working with SDSU to build a thriving digital humanities community between our two campuses and eventually throughout the California State University system.” Dr. Katherine Harris, Director of Public Programming the College of H&A, serves as an important planning partner and faculty liaison to the DHRI. | The DHRI offers SJSU King Library a special opportunity to strengthen DH at SJSU as we work to build the Digital Humanities Center (DHC) in the library over the next four years with the support of the NEH Challenge Grant. We look forward to the collaborations and partnerships the DHRI will bring among our SJSU campus partners as well as our colleagues at SDSU and the other CSU campuses. | For more information about the Summer 2022 Digital Humanities Research Institute, please contact Christina Mune, Associate Dean, at | christina.mune@sjsu.edu | . | January 31, 2022 Update | Digital Humanities at SJSU is gaining momentum with forward-thinking initiatives like the | Digital Humanities Center | , | Deep Humanities and Arts | , | Humanities & Arts in San José | , and countless | faculty research projects | . As a part of our work to bring continuity to these different initiatives across campus, the SJSU King Library Marketing Team and the College of Humanities & Arts (H&A) Marketing and Communications worked together to create a digital humanities logo. | We are excited to present the DH logo, a versatile and dynamic logo that articulates what digital humanities means to SJSU and beyond and communicates future work in this area. | Image | Collaboration | The SJSU King Library and H&A Marketing Teams worked closely with visual communications and design team members of SJSU Strategic Communications and Marketing (SCM), who provided valuable contributions and consultation for the creation of the DH logo. | Ideation | The SJSU King Library and H&A Marketing Teams led the ideation process with three important questions: | What does digital humanities mean? | How will it grow and evolve at SJSU? | How can we visually represent a broad and evolving discipline, while keeping the San José State University brand at its core? | To address these questions, each team developed designs and discussed the best ways to meet the goals presented. Visual representations of artificial intelligence, coding, robotics, circuit boards, algorithms, and human traits were all illustrated and proposed. | “It was a true collaboration and great to see both teams, especially the student assistants, involved in bouncing ideas back and forth to create a logo we all can be proud of,” observed Lesley Seacrist, project and communication manager of the SJSU King Library. | Creation | The teams continued the discussion and design process while inviting the SJSU SCM visual communications and design team to propose their own designs. Ultimately, through many rounds of collaboration and modifications, the team created a pitch deck of three potential designs to show the leadership teams. | Image | However, one design stood out from the rest early in the creation process. A simple interconnection of the letters “D” and “H” symbolizing the connection between the digital and human. The beveled squares are reminiscent of pixels on a screen, and a clean, modern font complements the three-layered grid. Its versatile design can transform into many iterations both in color and program. | “It’s our hope that this design can serve as a solid foundation and point of inspiration for our faculty, staff, students, and community to build upon as we explore the world of Digital Humanities.” shared Derick Truong, Student Intern Coordinator, College of Humanities and the Arts. | We are thrilled to present the DH logo and look forward to seeing it represent all the different work in digital humanities at SJSU. | May 1, 2021 | Welcome to the future Digital Humanities Center at SJSU! | SJSU King Library and the College of Humanities and Arts are excited to bring the Digital Humanities Center to SJSU. With a Digital Humanities Center, faculty and students will have: | Use of open source software, hands-on technology, and the expertise of librarians to help support the lifecycle of a project from the initial brainstorm of an idea to its implementation and expansion | Opportunities to collaborate with colleagues across campus on interdisciplinary projects | A space to explore and expand upon digital pedagogy in the classroom and beyond | We look forward to presenting updates on the center as it progresses. Updates will be shared here. Stay tuned! | Image"}
{"url": "https://library.sjsu.edu/digitalhumanities/what-digital-humanities", "title": "What is Digital Humanities? | Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library", "content": "What is Digital Humanities? | Image | DHC Home | | | NEH Grant | | | What is DH? | | | DHC Updates | | | DH Resources | Imagine being able to view illuminated medieval manuscripts on your computer, with Latin translations right alongside and x-ray images of layers of inks, papers, and even cat paws walking across the page... | Imagine viewing a digital archive with a visualization of pre-Hispanic archaeological sites in 3-D... | Imagine analyzing a million books and periodicals to assess the development of women’s rights... | Imagine tracking African Americans’ journeys during the 19th-century Great Migration as the U.S. population shifted... | Imagine discovering with the help of a neurologist that Agatha Christie suffered from dementia by analyzing the linguistic shifts in her later novels... | Imagine mapping Native American languages and land management strategies to enhance current public policy about wildfire management... | You are in the world of the digital humanities, where the values of the humanities meet digital methods from fields such as software design, gaming, and mapping, leading to the implementation of digital humanities values: openness, experimentation, collaboration, connectedness, and diversity (Spiro; | Honn | ). | This description of digital humanities (DH) promotes the “application of digital resources and methods to humanistic inquiry” (Waters). It is the use of “technological tools to do work of the kind that gets done in the humanities, asking the kinds of questions, whether they’re historical or literary,... [and] using computational tools that do the processing of the data and that assist the researcher in the findings that come out of that work” (Fitzpatrick). | “By producing and using new applications and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching and research possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture. Thus, a distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way relationship between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities research and subjects technology to humanistic questioning and interrogation, often simultaneously” (Terras; | Wikipedia | ). | “It is not simply the humanities done with computers, nor is it computer science performed on topics of interest to the humanities” (Vartner, Hswe). Digital humanities is a more comprehensive and encompassing approach to studying the humanities. Researchers in all disciplines are drawing upon technology such as infographics, data visualization and virtual reality among others to make their work more dynamic and engaging (Vartner; Hswe). | Another description of digital humanities covers a “more traditional humanities-oriented question[ing] about the computing technologies that we’re working with” (Fitzpatrick). Recent and ongoing debates about the pervasive role of technology in our everyday lives through social media, AI and e-commerce are illustrative examples.  As technology becomes more and more embedded in our lives, it has led to concerns over privacy, misinformation, and safety; thus, subjecting the “digital” to a humanistic critique. | San José State University’s Deep Humanities and the Arts Initiative is an approach following this description of digital humanities. Launched in spring 2018, the initiative asks, “Is technology the answer to humanity’s problems or a threat to humanity as we know it?” As it posits this question, it calls for “an urgent need to reinvent the humanities & arts, redefine their relationship to STEM, and revitalize their role in our lives” (Krishnaswamy). Many of the panel papers presented at the Deep Humanities and Arts Initiative launch addressed the call for this reinvention of the humanities and arts and its relationship to STEM. | Realistically, any form of teaching in the classroom today involves technology (especially true during this past year of remote learning) and is more capaciously identified as | digital pedagogy | (Harris). What does teaching look like when students learn “to think and work together in new ways, and to deepen their understanding of the academic subjects under consideration, through the use of such tools, platforms, and methods” to engage them in investigations using playfulness, openness, identity, agency, practice, and especially collaboration (Davis; Gold; Harris). | Faculty across campus are exploring ways to integrate | digital pedagogy | into their classrooms using a variety of technologically enhanced strategies, such as mapping a novel, using recordings to learn different languages, creating memes about climate change, and visualizing data in the study of earthquakes, traffic patterns, and COVID-19 vaccinations. A key resource in this area is the | Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models and Experiments, | a curated collection of reusable resources for teaching and research. This peer-reviewed, open access guide offers assignments, syllabi, rubrics, articles and more — all  searchable by keywords — to help educators integrate all types of tech into the classroom. | At San José State University, | digital humanities pedagogy | invites students to co-create knowledge through project-based classes: “By enabling communication across communities and networks, by creating platforms that amplify the voices of those most in need of being heard, by pursuing projects that perform the work of recovery and resistance, and by undertaking research that intervenes in the areas of data surveillance and privacy, the ‘artist-theorists, programming humanists, activist-scholars, theoretical archivists, [and] critical race coders’ whom Tara McPherson, writing in the first volume of | Debates in the Digital Humanities | , called into being, have now been united with their task” (Gold; Klein). Promoting, investigating, discovering the resonance of underrepresented voices doesn’t mean teaching a digital humanities course, though — experimentation and play are already key components of most SJSU curricula (Davis; Harris). | As an area of study, digital humanities is ever shifting and evolving, with students, faculty, and the community producing projects that underscore what makes the humanities so exciting, while allowing all to learn a number of new methods.  The educational possibilities are unlimited, for those who create these projects as well as for those who can benefit from them! | Explore the world of the digital humanities with us! | Davis, Rebecca Frost and Katherine D.
